## What?

A summary of the purpose of this piece of software, for example:
Delivery of Learnosity assessments to students and reporting student results to teachers.

### Diagram

A diagram showing all of the following:

* project inputs
* projects end users
* project outputs
* project data stores

([see mermaid documentation on how to create these diagrams](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/./flowchart?id=flowcharts-basic-syntax))

For example:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph project_components[Hypothetical Service]
    
        project_api[Hypothetical Service API]
        project_frontend[Hypothetical Service Frontend]
        subgraph datastores[Data Stores]
        postgres[PostgreSQL]
            queue[SQS queue service]
        end
    end

    subgraph inputs[Inputs]
        event_platform_input[Event Platform]
            cloud_canvas[Cloud Canvas API]
            identity[Identity Server]
    end
    

    subgraph end_users[End Users]
        student[Student]
            administrator[Administrator]
    end
    
    subgraph outputs[Outputs]
        event_platform_out[Event Platform]
    end
    
    event_platform_input -->|Canvas Change Events| project_api
    cloud_canvas -->|Canvas User API get| project_api
    identity -->|Authentication of users| project_frontend
    
    project_frontend -->|Views a thing| student
    administrator -->|Creates things| project_frontend
    
    project_api -->|Sends create and view messages| event_platform_out

```

## Local Install

A set of comprehensive instructions to install from scratch on a developer workstation. We suggest you test these with a member from another team. For example:

### mac

In this source directory:

1. install homebrew
2. install python 3.10 using homebrew `brew install python@3.10`
3. install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper `pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper`
4. create virtual environment for project `mkvirtualenv project_name -p /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3`
5. install project requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### known issues and fixes

If your system python does not include pip, you will need to make sure pip is installed :

```console
python -m ensurepip # if your system python is at least 3.4
```

If your system python isn't at least 3.4, you will need to use your system package manager to install pip.

### windows

In this source directory:

1. [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/)
2. open project in pycharm
3. set interpreter installed python 3.10
4. open shell
5. install project requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run tests locally

A set of instructions to run tests locally, for example:

```console
pytest
```

## Run service locally

A set of instructions to run service locally, for example:

### mac (service)

```console
python manage.py runserver
```

### windows (service)

```console
py manage.py runserver
```
