## Introduce & Enforce Strict Stand-up Standards Daily
* Start with burn down chart.
  * Determine the delta and what it takes to be on track

* Collapse all items.
  * Review only those that are "In Progress / Blocked"
  * Filter by NOT DONE
  * Talk only about what will be done (not yesterday)
  * Do not allow someone to be assigned to more than one sub-task
  * Do not end meeting without everyone being on a sub-task
  * Do the math on what is left for a story if in 2 hour increments will completing them get back on task?
  * Fight against WIP limits of more than 2 (Don't start new things without finishing the old ones)
  * Ask questions about anything sitting in In Progress more than one day (the dots on the cards)

## Capacity Planning
* Since the team will have less than full capacity this sprint, this is a good time to introduce a technique for Capacity Planning
* Create table containing each team member on the vertical axis and the days of the sprint in the horizontal axis
* Choose a number to use for the max hours of work time per day (the actual number isn't important since it will be used to derive a percentage)
* Fill in, up to the max hours, the availability for each person per day. If someone will be out or have partial availability on certain days, be sure to indicate by reducing their time for those days
* Total up the capacity for the sprint and divide it by the the maximum team capacity (availability percentage)
* Use the Insights tool in Jira to determine the average velocity for the past 5 sprints
* Multiply the availability percentage by the average velocity
* The resulting number is the target committment story points for the team for the sprint

## Driving Toward Shorter Cycle Time
* Review cycle time data from Holistics
* Reflect on oppotunities to deliver value in smaller chunks
* Discuss the importance for shorter cycle times
  * Shorter feedback cycles
  * Better guage of progress
* Look ahead for oppotunities to split stories
* Work with product to split stories during backlog grooming
