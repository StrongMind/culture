## Introduce & Enforce Strict Stand-up Standards Daily
* Start with burn down chart.
  * Determine the delta and what it takes to be on track

* Collapse all items.
  * Review only those that are "In Progress / Blocked"
  * Filter by NOT DONE
  * Talk only about what will be done (not yesterday)
  * Do not allow someone to be assigned to more than one sub-task
  * Do not end meeting without everyone being on a sub-task
  * Do the math on what is left for a story if in 2 hour increments will completing them get back on task?
  * Fight against WIP limits of more than 2 (Don't start new things without finishing the old ones)
  * Ask questions about anything sitting in In Progress more than one day (the dots on the cards)
