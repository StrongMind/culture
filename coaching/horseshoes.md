## Openly Opinionated and Bias to Action

When we openly share opinions, ideas and concerns it provides the opportunity for others to ask questions, to understand, and respond. Communicating openly helps us understand where we are or are not aligned with others. 

* Introduce Decider Protocol and encourage bias to action
* Introduce Investigate Protocol as a tool for seeking clarification or uncovering non-alignment

## Understanding and Using Capacity Planning
* Start by understanding what the team capacity has been for the past 5 sprints
* Compare to the actual delivery of the recent sprints
* Talk about the importance of reliability to Product
  * Reduces surprises about what will be delivered
  * allows a predictive roadmap (and gives them more than a week's warning that you are running out of work)
  * may affect the prioritization of work or the "must have" scope
* Work with PO to fill your iteration board "sprints" based on team capacity
* at the end of each iteration, check in on the iterations board. 
* Did you complete what you intended? Are you still stocked with work in the backlog?

## Introduce Concept of Broken Windows
* Start pushing all Sentry items to Jira
* Start pushing all Sentry items to #alerts-team-horseshoes slack channel

* Run Daily "Bugs Report"
  * Include only task type "Bug" for between status
  * Include Time to Open for Items Updated during Current Week
  * Include Lead Time for Items Updated during Current Week
  * Include Cycle Time for Items Update during Current Week

* Post questions on outliers

Take notes on what you are observing and share in #team-new52
