# Horseshoes
## Understanding and Using Capacity Planning
* Start by understanding what the team capacity has been for the past 5 sprints
* Compare to the actual delivery of the recent sprints
* Talk about the importance of reliability to Product
  * Reduces surprises about what will be delivered
  * allows a predictive roadmap (and gives them more than a week's warning that you are running out of work)
  * may affect the prioritization of work or the "must have" scope
* Work with PO to fill your iteration board "sprints" based on team capacity
* at the end of each iteration, check in on the iterations board. 
* Did you complete what you intended? Are you still stocked with work in the backlog?
