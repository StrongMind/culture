## Introduce & Enforce Strict Stand-up Standards Daily
* Start with burn down chart.
  * Determine the delta and what it takes to be on track

* Collapse all items.
  * Review only those that are "In Progress / Blocked"
  * Filter by NOT DONE
  * Talk only about what will be done (not yesterday)
  * Do not allow someone to be assigned to more than one sub-task
  * Do not end meeting without everyone being on a sub-task
  * Do the math on what is left for a story if in 2 hour increments will completing them get back on task?
  * Fight against WIP limits of more than 2 (Don't start new things without finishing the old ones)
  * Ask questions about anything sitting in In Progress more than one day (the dots on the cards)

## Ask for Help

* Review the concept of [asking for help](https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/ask-for-help).
* Individually, identify something you are having trouble moving forward on
* In round robin fashion, ask one of your teammates for help in the form of "Will you..."

* Next, identify something the team is stuck moving forward on
* Clearly articulate what you want want help with
* Identify who to direct the ask for help to (i.e. another team, manager)

* Retrospectively, identify past situations where progress has stalled
  * Hint: check the cycle time of past stories, bugs and even subtasks
* How could an ask for help enabled the team to get past the hurdle sooner?
* What are some strategies SM and SMLP can incorporate to address time zone differnces when asking for help?
