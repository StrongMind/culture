## Refresh on Good Pairing Practices
* Provided team with infographic / suggestions
* Group "pop quiz" based on infographic
* Challenge them to choose one good practice to focus on in next pairing. Then share back. 
  * What did you choose to focus on?
  * How did that practice help your pairing?
  * Any negatives?
* Team commits to adopt practices that improved the pairing sessions. 
* Reflections on how effective pairing helps over all progress.

## Understanding and Following Capacity Planning
* Start by understanding what the team capacity has been for the past 5 sprints
* Compare to the actual delivery of the recent sprints
* Talk about the importance of reliability to Product
  * Reduces surprises about what will be delivered
  * allows a predictive roadmap
  * may affect the prioritization of work or the "must have" scope
* Challenge: in the next planning use the capacity average to commit to only that amount of work.

## Introduce & Enforce Strict Stand-up Standards Daily
* Start with burn down chart.
  * Determine the delta and what it takes to be on track

* Collapse all items.
  * Review only those that are "In Progress / Blocked"
  * Filter by NOT DONE
  * Talk only about what will be done (not yesterday)
  * Do not allow someone to be assigned to more than one sub-task
  * Do not end meeting without everyone being on a sub-task
  * Do the math on what is left for a story if in 2 hour increments will completing them get back on task?
  * Fight against WIP limits of more than 3 (Don't start new things without finishing the old ones)
  * Ask questions about anything sitting in In Progress more than one day (the dots on the cards)
