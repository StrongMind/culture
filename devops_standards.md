# DevOps Standards

As part of the [Box of Autonomy]() teams are given a starting point for choices.  This is a living and breathing set of standards.

The use of **deprecrated** will be denoted when something is no longer part of the standard but may be supported for period of time.  Items that are deprecated should no longer be used for anything new.  When possible efforts to move away from them should be done.

The use of **obsolete** will be denoted when something is no longer part of the standard and is no longer supported.  Items that are obsolete should be prioritized where it makes sense to be moved to supported technologies.
