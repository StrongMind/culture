#### Proposal 
with @qwerty-talk doing some work with calendars in smc pretty soon, i think it's time we decide on a standard for calendar gems. it seems like there's one gem  with 2.6 million downloads called simple_calendar, written by Chris Oliver and regularly maintained. there are others here but they're not regularly maintained or don't give us what we need.
simple_calendar is  easy to implement and can render events based off active records like sessions. it also provides a generator for the calendar views so we can style them to meet our needs. example implementation video.
i propose we choose simple_calendar as the standard rails gem for implementing frontend calendars. 3.2.1

#### Proposal
The rails template is currently set to deploy to prod on any push to main with new rails apps. With this change auto building and pushing to stage seems to be less of a necessity against main.

I propose we update the template for new rails apps to be a manual release to stage for testing branches and pr's instead of auto deploy of main. 1.2.3.
