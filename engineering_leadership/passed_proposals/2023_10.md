#### Proposal 
with @qwerty-talk doing some work with calendars in smc pretty soon, i think it's time we decide on a standard for calendar gems. it seems like there's one gem  with 2.6 million downloads called simple_calendar, written by Chris Oliver and regularly maintained. there are others here but they're not regularly maintained or don't give us what we need.
simple_calendar is  easy to implement and can render events based off active records like sessions. it also provides a generator for the calendar views so we can style them to meet our needs. example implementation video.
i propose we choose simple_calendar as the standard rails gem for implementing frontend calendars. 3.2.1
