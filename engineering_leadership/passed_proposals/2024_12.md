#### Proposal

I propose that we run:
```bash
rubocop --auto-gen-config
```

On Central, and we commit the changes the central with the rubocop.yml, and rubocop_todo.yml (basically a todo-list of all of our rubocop violations).

I propose if you bypass a bullet warning in local development while working on a feature you create a subtask in the current story you are working on to fix the N+1 before the story can be considered complete, if it is an existing N+1 you will create a story in your current sprint and prioritize it to be completed next
