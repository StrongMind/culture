#### Proposal

```
I propose we add rack-mini-profiler, stackprof and memory-profiler to our approved gem list. 

These gems will enable us to get performance metrics in both dev and prod through an on page interface. 

I have an example of their installation and usage in this [PR](https://github.com/StrongMind/central/pull/1984)
```
