#### Proposal

```
I propose we add rack-mini-profiler, stackprof and memory-profiler to our approved gem list. 

These gems will enable us to get performance metrics in both dev and prod through an on page interface. 

I have an example of their installation and usage in this [PR](https://github.com/StrongMind/central/pull/1984)
```

```
i propose we add geocoder to the approved list of gems for development. It is used to translate addresses to lat/long and can do distance calculations. Current need is distance between students and testing locations to match them with the nearest one for state testing. 3, 2, 1
