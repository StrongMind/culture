# Metrics

## Primary

### Planned Strategic Items (Value)

*What*: Planned strategic items are those that are in epics that are part the strategic roadmap.

*Why*: Progress towards strategic objectives increases the value of StrongMind for the customer.

*How*: Expressed as story points or number of stories/tasks per iteration period. Also, expressed as a percentage of total work completed per iteration period.

### Unplanned Work (Quality)

*What*: Unplanned work represents work that was not in the plan.  Whether they be outages or emergencies they represent work that is a lack of quality in the pipeline.

*Why*: Lack of quality upsets the customer experience and impacts value delivery.

*How*: Expressed as number of unplanned stories/tasks per iteration period.  Also, expressed as a percentage of total work completed per iteration period.

## Secondary

### Lead Time (Efficiency)

*What*: Lead time measures the total time from the moment a story enters the system (backlog), until it is completed (done).  It measures the total time for a requirement to be realized and start earning value.  The speed of your value chain.

*Why*:Lead time is more important than velocity because it measures the system from end to end.  Reducing lead time means the entire pipeline is becoming more efficient.

*How*: Expressed as average number days/hours it takes a story/task to move from added to backlog to done.

### Cycle Time (Productivity)

*What:* Cycle time is a subset of lead time.  It measures the time for a unit to go from "in progress" to "done".  Separate cycle times for sub-tasks and parent stories/tasks/defects.

*Why:* A very simple metric that can raise a red flag when items are not moving forward.

*How*: Expressed as average number days/hours it takes a story/task to move from "in progress" to "done" also average number of days/hours it takes a sub-task to move from "in progress" to "done".
