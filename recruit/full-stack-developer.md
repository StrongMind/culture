# Full Stack Developer

At StrongMind we work in terms of user stories with varying degrees of requirements along with lots of feedback cycles.

Any language/framework for submissions is acceptable. Python or Ruby preferred.

3. Deploy your application (see below for options) 
4. Email [recruiter@strongmind.com](mailto:recruiter@strongmind.com) links to your application repository and working deployed application with the subject â€œ**Full Stack Developer Candidate - Your Name**"
