## Frame Scoring
A frame consists of 2 opportunities to knock down 10 bowling pins with a bowling ball.  The 10 pins are then reset for the next frame

### Strike
If you knock down all 10 pins in the first shot of a frame, you get a strike.
**Score:** A strike earns 10 points plus the sum of your next two shots.

### Spare
If you knock down all 10 pins using both shots of a frame, you get a spare.
**Score:** A spare earns 10 points plus the sum of your next one shot.

### Open Frame
If you do not knock down all 10 pins using both shots of your frame, you have an open frame.
**Score:** An open frame only earns the number of pins knocked down.

### 10th Frame
The 10th frame is a bit different.  
* If you roll a strike in the first shot of the 10th frame, you get 2 more shorts.  
* If you roll a spare in the first two shots, you get 1 more shot.
* If you leave the 10th frame open after two shots, the game is over and you do not get an additional shot.
**Score:**
The score for the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down in the 10th frame.
