# UI/UX Designer Pizza Exercise 

At StrongMind, we believe that a strong user experience drives successful products. We focus on user stories to keep our users at the heart of our design process. Your task is to simulate a UI/UX workflow by designing the front end of a pizza management application. 

## Instructions

1. **Research & Insights** Document your understanding of the potential users and any assumptions you make during the design process.
2. **Wireframes & User Flows** Create low-fidelity wireframes and user flows based on the provided user stories.
3. **Prototyping** Develop a high-fidelity prototype that demonstrates the interactions.
4. **HTML/CSS Proficiency** Create a basic, responsive front-end (static mockup) for one of the pages. It can be as simple as a toppings page or a pizza creation page.
5. **Documentation** Describe your design decisions and rationale behind them. Explain any user experience considerations or insights that influenced your design.
6. Create a GitHub repository for this project.
7. Email recruiter@strongmind.com links to your GitHub repository and any hosted prototype (if you choose to host it) with the subject “UI/UX Designer Candidate - Your Name." Make sure your Figma files have the correct permissions set so our team can view your files!
 

## User Stories

**1. Manage Toppings UI** 

* As a pizza store owner, I should see a visually appealing dashboard to manage toppings. 

* I should be able to easily identify each topping through visuals or names. 

* Adding, updating, or deleting a topping should be intuitive. 

* Feedback should be clear when I try to enter duplicate toppings. 


\
Consider accessibility when designing the UI. 


\
**2. Manage Pizzas UI**

As a pizza chef, I need a creation space where I can visualize my pizzas. 

* The design should help me differentiate between various pizzas and their toppings. 

* Adding, updating, or deleting a pizza, or its toppings, should be a straightforward process. 

* Ensure that the UI provides feedback when duplicate pizza names are entered. 

\
Consider designing for different devices: desktop, tablet, and mobile. 


 

**Optional Deployment** If you wish to demonstrate your prototype in a live environment, you can deploy it to a service of your choice. Check out the resources below for suggestions. 

 
 

## Evaluation Criteria 

**User-Centered Design** Does the design consider the needs and usability for its users? 

**Clarity & Simplicity** Are the designs clear and the interactions intuitive? 

**Responsiveness & Accessibility** How well does the HTML/CSS mockup adapt to different device sizes? Is the design accessible to all users, including those with disabilities? 

**Aesthetic** While this is subjective, the design should be modern and appealing. 

**Documentation** Is the rationale behind design decisions clear? Are there insights provided on UX considerations? 

 

 

Best of luck! We’re excited to see how you approach this challenge and your design process.
