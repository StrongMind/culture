# Experiment: New Cohort Format

**Cohort Breakdown**
* There will no longer be a breakdown of cohort 1, 2, 3, etc

**Cohort Schedule**
* Cohort sessions will be held twice per week for 1 hour
* Each session will cover a different topic so there will be 2 different topics per week
* Schedule/topics will be posted prior to the start of the 6 week cohort session

**Cohort Expectations**
* Each person is required to select one session to attend per week
* Attending both sessions per week is encouraged and recommended
