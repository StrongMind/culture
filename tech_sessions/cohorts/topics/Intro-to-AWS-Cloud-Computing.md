## Introduction to Cloud Computing
Types of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
There are three cloud computing models available on AWS.

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: It is the basic building block of cloud IT. It generally provides access to data storage space, networking features, and computer hardware(virtual or dedicated hardware). It is highly flexible and gives management controls over the IT resources to the developer. For example, VPC, EC2, EBS.
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: This is a type of service where AWS manages the underlying infrastructure (usually operating system and hardware). This helps the developer to be more efficient as they do not have to worry about undifferentiated heavy lifting required for running the applications such as capacity planning, software maintenance, resource procurement, patching, etc., and focus more on deployment and management of the applications. For example, RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch.
* **Software as a Service(SaaS)**: It is a complete product that usually runs on a browser. It primarily refers to end-user applications. It is run and managed by the service provider. The end-user only has to worry about the application of the software suitable to its needs. For example, Saleforce.com, Web-based email, Office 365 .

## Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS services are typically grouped into different categories like compute, networking, storage, applications, databases, and analytics.

**Compute**
* Amazon EC2: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud
* AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that allows you to run code without managing servers.
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service that facilitates quick deployment of your applications by providing all the application services that you need for your application.

**Networking**
* Amazon VPC: Amazon VPC is your network environment in the cloud.
* Amazon Route 53: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

**Storage**
* Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is object storage with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. 
* Amazon Glacier: Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backup. 

**Databases**
* Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
* Amazon DynamoDB (Non-Relational Database): Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.
