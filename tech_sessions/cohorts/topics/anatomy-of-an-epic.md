# Results Oriented - The Anatomy of an Epic

# Introduction

Welcome to Result-Oriented – The Anatomy of an Epic

Before we start, I would like to ask a question. Don't say it out loud, keep it to yourself. You will not be asked to provide this number at any time, so be honest with yourself.

From a scale of 1 to 5

_ **How satisfied are you with your job?** _

1 = Not satisfied

5 = Extremely Satisfied

Remember this, it will be important later…

# Result-Oriented

## What is Result-Oriented?

**Definition according to Google:**

Result-oriented is a term used to describe an individual or organization that focuses on outcome.

{teacher notes: You guys know what results oriented means so we can go home now, right?.}

Does this definition fit your understanding of Results?

## What should Outcome include? (Quiz)

Question: What MUST an Outcome contain to have an affective result-oriented mindset?

Answer: Value

## New Definition

Result-oriented is a term used to describe an individual or organization that focuses on outcome, where outcome contains VALUE

What else do we use at StrongMind to represent value?

Epic

# Epics

## What is an Epic

Let's use an epic as an example to show a result-oriented process.

To make sure we are on the same page, we will first give a high-level overview of what an epic is.

Then we will create an epic together to understand it.

An Epic is not just a bucket. An Epic represents value, it is a result of the work done to achieve the value.

## Components

Define the Epic

- Name
- Value Statement

Acceptance Criteria

It shall do this

It shall do that

KPI's

Should have X% increase in Y showing [some type of] value.

Stories

As a [user] I want to [have something] so that I may [achieve something]

## Process

Steps in the process

- Define (Create and define your Epic)
- Discovery
- In Progress
- Validation
- Done

Alternate paths

- Done
- Discovery
- In Progress

# Building an Epic

## Components

### Define

First, we want to define the Epic. We have talked about results, so let's make the value of the Epic "Understanding what it means to be Result-oriented"

Is that a good Epic Title? Can you see value in it?

### Value

What about

"Becoming a result-oriented organization."

Value Statement:

Becoming a result-oriented company allows SM to focus on the "value" of what we are doing, and bring that value to our customers and to each other.

Remember, it is not just about completing tasks.

- A task is to Understand "result-oriented".
- Value is in becoming result-oriented.

### Why

One trick to finding value is to act like a 3-year-old and ask Why.

Why, why, why.

Keep asking why until you get to the value.

- Why train?
  - Marc said to.
- Why did Marc say to?
  - Derek said to.
- Why did Derek say to?
  - To learn about being Result-Oriented.
- Why do we want to learn about being result-oriented?
  - To become a result-oriented organization.

Now we have value.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria clearly defines expectations of what should be accomplished before moving the Epic into validation.

1. Everyone has attended training.
2. Everyone knows what results-oriented means.
3. Everyone can give an example.

Others?

1. People on teams can apply what they have learned to know the value of an Epic/work they are doing.

What can you think of that will help us achieve the value of this Epic?

## KPI's

When creating KPI's, ask yourself:

- "Why is this more important than something else?"
- "How will we know when we have achieved value?"

In our example:

- Why is this important
  - Why is this training more important than other training we could do at this time?
- How do we know when being result-oriented brings value?
  - Making an Impact for our Customers.
  - Improved job satisfaction.
  - Team Improvement.
  - Growing the business.
  - Making sure we are working on the right thing.

How do we measure this?

This is how we build our KPI's.

- 5% increase in customer satisfaction with products delivered this year.
- 5% increase in job satisfaction
- 5 people come back and tell the trainers how it made a difference with their team.
- Students using StrongMind increases from 15,000 to 20,000 in one year.
- Survey the SAS (Sales and Service) team and find out if what we have been building the past 6 months have filled 91% of their priority items

### Difference between Acceptance Criteria and KPI's

A lot of times the lines between the Acceptance Criteria and KPI's can become a little blurry.

The primary difference between acceptance criteria and a KPI is that acceptance criteria defines what must be done to achieve value from the Epic, The KPI's prove (or disprove) that the value was achieved.

## Stories

### Preparation

Now that we have answered the question "How will we know when we have achieved value?" and created the KPI's from them, do we need to do anything to measure those KPI's?

- As the trainer I want to Measure customer satisfaction with products delivered this past year so that I may compare them to results from this year.
- As the trainer I want to Measure job satisfaction prior to giving the course so that I may ask again in 6 months to see if it has improved.
  - (now you know why you were asked that question at the beginning. You know your number now. In 3 months I can ask you again and you will be able to tell me if your job satisfaction has improved or not).

### Achieving the Value

Stories are the steps that we need to take in order to achieve the value.

- As a trainer I want to Prepare Training so that I will be ready to lead the training.
- As the trainer I want to Give the Training so that the knowledge is shared with my organization.
- As a Trainer I want to do Follow-up training to make sure the organization really understands how to be a result-oriented organization.

Keep in mind that stories are flexible, especially at this point. As the teams dig into the epic, they may remove, modify, or add stories based on their expertise.

## A walk in the life of our Epic

In Process:

- We are giving the training now
- Lets say we are done with training

Can I move from In Process to Validation

- What does it take to move to validation?
- Is all of our Acceptance Criteria met?
- Are all the stories complete?
  - We have not completed the story for Follow-up training.
  - Do we need to finish it?

Can I move it from Validation to done?

- Did we fulfill enough value to be happy with our results?

Should it move from validation to In Process?

- Maybe we are not happy with the value provided so far and want to do the last story and have a follow-up training.

Should it move from validation to discovery?

- Maybe after doing all the stories we still do not have the value we want

Should it move from discovery to In Process or to Done?

- After doing discovery, did we find that with a reasonable amount of work we think we can get the value we want so we add stories and move it to in process
- After doing discovery we find that the amount of work required to get additional value is not worth it so we decide to move it to done,

An Epic is a living entity.

It can change statuses many times and in many different ways.

To drive towards value, the stories can be added, modified, and removed.

# Summary

## Key points

Result-oriented is a term used to describe an individual or organization that focuses on outcome, where outcome contains VALUE.

An Epic also shows value.

An Epic is not just a bucket. An Epic represents value, it is a result of the work done to achieve the value.

An epic is made up of:

Define the Epic

- Name
- Value Statement

Acceptance Criteria

It shall do this

It shall do that

KPI's

Should have X% increase in Y showing [some type of] value.

Stories

As a [user] I want to [have something] so that I may [achieve something]

An Epic is a living entity that can change in order to achieve VALUE

Did I mention VALUE!

# Exercise

Get into groups of 2-3 people and come up with your own example for an Epic.

The key focus of this exercise is to show VALUE.

Start by creating an epic name that demonstrates value.

Next add your value statement.

If time permits, finish the epics by adding:

- Acceptance Criteria
- KPI's that prove the value
- Stories that will achieve the value
