# Automated Testing Techniques

## What is automated testing?
* refers to any approach that makes it possible to run your tests without human intervention
* created once and can run any time you need it

## Why use automated testing?
* allows you to do more testing, faster, and more efficiently
* improved scale
* speed of delivery (speeds up regression testing)
* allows retest during development

## Types of automated testing
* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* System testing
  * functional
  * regression
  * smoke
* Acceptance tests
* Behaviorial tests
* Performance tests
* A/B testing 

## Best Practices
1. Plan your testing. Make sure your test cases are clearly defined and well written. 
2. Test as early and as often as possible during development.
3. Test cases should be self-contained and easy to understand.
4. Schedule testing automatically, ideally when new code is pushed. 
5. Set up alerts so you are told as soon as a test fails.
6. Remember that you need to constantly reassess your test plans as your app develops and changes.

## Test Driven Development
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons
3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
4. All tests should now pass
5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved
6. Repeat
