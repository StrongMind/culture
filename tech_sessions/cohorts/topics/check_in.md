## Check in
Adds value to team interactions
### Steps
1. Speaker says “I feel [one or more of MAD, SAD, GLAD, AFRAID].” Speaker may provide a brief explanation. Or if others have already checked in, the speaker may say “I pass.” (See the PassLinks to an external site. protocol.)
2. Speaker says “I’m in.” This signifies that Speaker intends to behave according to the Core Commitments.
3. Listeners respond, “Welcome.”
### Commitments
* State feelings without qualification.
* State feelings only as they pertain to yourself.
* Be silent during another’s Check In.
* Do not refer to another’s Check In disclosures without explicitly granted permission from him or her.
### Notes
* In the context of the Core Protocols, all emotions are expressed through combinations of MAD, SAD, GLAD, or AFRAID. For example, “excited” may be a combination of GLAD and AFRAID.
* Check In as deeply as possible. Checking in with two or more emotions is the norm. The depth of a group’s Check In translates directly to the quality of the group’s results.
* Do not do anything to diminish your emotional state. Do not describe yourself as a “little” mad, sad, glad, or afraid or say “I’m mad, but I’m still glad.”
* Except in large groups, if more than one person checks in, it is recommended that all do so.
* HAPPY may be substituted for GLAD, and SCARED may be substituted for AFRAID.

## Check Out
Check Out requires that your physical presence always signifies your engagement. You must Check Out when you are aware that you cannot maintain the Core Commitments or whenever it would be better for you to be elsewhere.

### Steps
1. Say “I’m checking out.” or "I co"
2. Physically leave the group until you’re ready to Check InLinks to an external site. once again.
3. Optionally, if it is known and relevant, you can say when you believe you’ll return.
4. Those who are present for the Check Out may not follow the person, talk to or about the person checking out or otherwise chase him or her.
### Commitments
* Return as soon as you can and are able to keep the Core Commitments.
* Return and Check InLinks to an external site. without unduly calling attention to your return.
* Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate, or punish anyone who checks out.
### Notes
* When you Check Out do it as calmly and gracefully as possible so as to cause minimal disruption to others.
* Check Out if your emotional state is hindering your success, if your receptivity to new information is too low, or if you do not know what you want.
* Check Out is an admission that you are unable to contribute at the present time.
