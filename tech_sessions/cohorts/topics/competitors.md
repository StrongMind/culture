## Industry Overview

### Understanding Our Market

Online Learning	
Online learning has revolutionized education and StrongMind has been on the front lines, over the past twenty years.

But why is online education the way to go?
What role will online education play in the future?
This module will take you from reasons why online learning can and is more effective than fact-to-face along with learning about our competitors and how we can be a differentiator.

Top Reasons Why Online is Successful
 
Students Gain More Knowledge Than in Standard Classes
According to research, student in online learning courses incorporating multimedia content learn five times more material than traditional face-to-face instruction.

 

Higher Rate of Retention with Online Learning
Online courses have increased student retention rates from 25-60% according to the Research Institute of America. Contributing factors include more engaging multimedia, flexibility, and classes not interfering with other obligations.

 

Online Learning Requires Less of a Time-Consuming Commitment
The majority of online options allow students to divide their course time in a way that works with their schedule and commitments. They don't need to only dedicate a large amount of time to the course, but can break it up as their time permits. This is particularly valuable for adult learners.

 

More Frequent Evaluations Helps Decrease Distractions
An advantage of online courses is that assessments can become a continuous process. Harvard researchers found that adopting short, regular exams reduced student distraction, ,quadrupled note-taking, and enhanced overall content recall.

 

Online is a More Eco-Friendly Option
Online learning is better for the environment. Online courses consume 90% less energy and release 85% less CO2 per student than traditional in-person courses. 

### The Online Learning Market
In March 2023, TechnavioLinks to an external site. completed a report that estimated that the online learning market (Higher Education, Corporate, and K12) in the US is estimated to increase by $48.4 billion dollars between 2022 and 2027.

This shows a rapidly growing market with content as the largest segment, followed by technology, and then services.

There are a lot of players in this market, not just included K12.

 

But who are our competitors that we are being compared to in the K12 space?

### Accelerate Education
[Accelerate EducationLinks to an external site.](https://accelerate.education/)
Accelerate Education provides online education courses for Kindergarten through 12th grade to meet the needs of all students, from at-risk students who had trouble succeeding in the traditional classroom to high achieving students seeking classes their schools cannot provide for them.

StrongMind has a strong relationship with Accelerate as they have helped us round out our curriculum offerings with courses we do not create. But the lack of quality in those courses has been brought back to StrongMind through customer feedback.

Accelerate Differentiators

Accelerate's differentiator is providing the innovative tools to support all learners and this is built into their curriculum offerings to provide personalization.

Online Learning

Alternative Programs
Credit Recovery
Summer School

https://vimeo.com/772168930

What it Means to Us
District partners and customers looking to implement a virtual/hybrid/blended program has gone through a huge change over the past couple years:

Covid has educated everyone on online education
Schools still have resources for managing online learning
Incentives are still in place to implement online learning
Schools know what they want and they want the control
The sales team is fielding more technical questions, opportunities want access, they want to customize, and they want control.

Customer is in control	
This means we must:
Provide options
Deliver the product to them
Be consultative and educated

### A-La-Carte and Customization
It's a Delicate Tetris
Schools want the ability to customize and create the courses to meet the individual needs of their population. No longer is the online educational world a one-size-fits-all. Recent inquiries include:

Course customization to add new content
Assessment customization to meet the needs of special populations, IEPs, 504s
Test item pools and test forms
Reordering the content to align with state testing schedule
Student-level pacing
Student-level pre-requisites
Using multiple vendors in one LMS
 

How Others Compare
The opportunities who have been managed from other schools like Stride or Connections Academy are looking for other curriculum providers because of the lack of school customization. 

Must request reordering of courses
Can not consume various providers
Proprietary LMS/SIS with not option for customization
Lack of action on feedback
Support takes months to resolve issues

SaS Goal: To win with world-class service AND product
