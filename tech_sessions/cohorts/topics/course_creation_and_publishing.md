# From Roadmap to the LMS: A Course Journey

## Roadmap/Scope
- deciding what course to build 
-- partner feedback, competitive analysis
- deciding what state to build to
-- where are our partners?

## Planning
- standards selection
-- state standards are required to be met
- standards alignment (crosswalk)
-- cross-map standards from one state to another in order to build a course for more than one state at a time
- course blueprint/plan
-- standards are layed out in a course structure to plan where they were going to be taught and where they will be assessed
- SHOW AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THEY ARE USING
- start creating content (curriculum developers)
- media and interactives (media requests)

ADD SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM HERE 

## In Class Activity
- plan your own "course" (give them the steps (standards) of learning something and have them plot that out into a course)

## Content (Helios)
- all activity pages of the content the student will learn
- outputs as LTI
### What is LTI?
- explain LTI briefly
- exports as url
- requires key/secret

- ADD SCREEN RECORDING OF ADDING HELIOS CONTENT

## Assessments
- all assessments in a course (unit exams, final exams, checkpoints?, workbooks? or are those in Helios?)
- learnosity
- What is smart assessment? Our old assessment builder (built in-house)
- SHOW A DEMO OF LEARNOSITY. MARC WILL FUMBLE AROUND WITH IT 

## Tying it all together
- CDS
- add course and establish course structure (units/lessons/activites)
- point to Helios/Learnosity urls
- review (functionality and pedogical)
- export course into catman
- ADD COURSE IN DEV CDS AND EXPORT TO DEV CATMAN DEMO

## Publishing
- CatMan
- Adding a course
- Version history
- Assign to schools 
- common cartridges (link to ims standard)
- what is it?
- show a cartridge

## In Class Activity
- limit scope of what they can do (helios, learnosity, cds??)
