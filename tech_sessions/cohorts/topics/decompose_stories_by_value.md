# Decompose Stories By Value

## When to Decompose
* Doesn't fit in an iteration
* To get better estimates

## Story Types
* Epics vs Stories vs Features vs Tasks vs Themes

## How to Split

### Patterns
* Workflow steps (ex: ecommerce checkout)
* Simple vs Complex (ex: multiple shipping address)
* Business Rule Variations (ex: state taxes)
* Operations (ex:CRUD)
* Data (ex: prime vs non-prime)
* Variations in Interface (ex: mobile, alexa)
* System Qualities (performance, logging, etc)
* Happy vs Unhappy Path (ex: credit card info expired)

## Keeping Value in Mind
* vertical vs horizontal slicing
* feedback
* function
* monetary

### Do Not Split by Task
* front end, back end, etc
* Use tracer bullets

## Avoid Temptation of Related Changes
* While I am in there I will just...

## Work Through Examples
