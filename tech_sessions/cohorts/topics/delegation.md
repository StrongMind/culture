# Delegation

Delegation is the act of entrusting someone else with a task or responsibility. It is an essential skill for engineering managers, as it allows them to free up their time to focus on more strategic tasks.

## The Importance of Delegation

As an engineering manager, you'll have to delegate tasks and responsibilities to your team members. Delegation is an essential skill for a manager as it allows you to accomplish more as a team and develop your employees' skills and experience.  Delegation allows you to focus on high-level tasks while empowering your team to take ownership of their work.

### Implementation

Choose the right tasks to delegate. Not all tasks are created equal. Some tasks are better suited for delegation than others. Managers should choose tasks that are:
* Appropriate for the employee's skill level and experience
* Within the employee's scope of responsibility
* Well-defined and with clear instructions

#### Clearly Define the Task

Once you've identified the right person for the task, clearly define what is expected of them. Provide detailed instructions and make sure they understand the scope of the task, the timeline, and any relevant constraints. This will help ensure that they have a clear understanding of what they need to do and can successfully complete the task.
* The desired outcome of the task
* The deadline for completion
* The level of autonomy that the employee has
* The resources that the employee will need

Explain the reasoning behind the task you are delegating. This helps your team understand the importance of the task and how it fits into the bigger picture.  Provide clear documentation and expectations for the task you are delegating. This includes deadlines, deliverables, and any other relevant information.

#### Provide the Necessary Resources and Support

To set your team members up for success, make sure they have access to the necessary resources and support. This may include tools, information, training, or guidance from you or other team members. Be available to answer questions and provide feedback throughout the process.

#### Empower Your Team Members

When delegating tasks, it's important to give your team members the freedom and autonomy to complete the task in their own way. This allows them to develop their own problem-solving skills and encourages them to take ownership of the task.  Trust your team to complete it. Avoid micromanaging and allow your team to take ownership of their work.

#### Monitor Progress and Provide Feedback

While you want to give your team members autonomy, you still need to monitor their progress and provide feedback to ensure they're on track. Be available to answer questions.  Schedule regular check-ins to review progress, answer any questions, and provide guidance as needed.

#### Recognize and Reward Success

When your team members successfully complete a delegated task, make sure to recognize and reward their efforts. This could be as simple as a verbal acknowledgment or more substantial recognition such as a promotion, bonus, or other incentive. Celebrating successes will encourage your team members to continue to grow and develop their skills.
