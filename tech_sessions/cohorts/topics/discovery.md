# Discovery and Research

## Identify the Problem
* identify broad challenges you are trying to solve with your product
* big picture, high-level objectives or themes
* Example: How can we enable mid-market companies to better use Productboard? (also an example of HMW!)
* Types of challenges:
** There are new product challenges, where you work on an open-ended blank slate
** There are value and need-oriented challenges, which revolve around the current needs and pain points of your users.
** Then there are growth vs. technical challenges. Growth challenges are usually quantitative â€” maybe you are trying to improve a metric within your product, like user retention. Technical challenges are often related to product performance.
