# Effective 1-on-1s

## Benefits

### Build Trust
An opportunity to get to know each other on a personal level — which can, over time, lead to a stronger rapport and greater trust.

### Face-to-Face Time
Use these check-ins to understand how they can best support their direct reports, share an appreciation for their contributions, and get a pulse check on employee morale.

Gives you designated time to connect with your remote employees on a personal level, build trust, and ensure that they’re kept in the loop on projects and team updates.

### Provide Meaning to The Work
Day-to-day duties can feel disconnected from the company’s purpose and mission. 1-on-1s are a great place to help draw connections between the day-to-day work and its contributions to the department and organization.
### Cover Personal Topics
Provides a private and safe environment for employees to discuss more personal topics.

Once these issues are out in the open, managers can discuss the best way to move forward.

Be empathetic when people come forward with these types of challenges, so they feel supported and comfortable opening up about personal issues in the future

### Discuss Growth
This is also a good time to check in on how they are progressing with their growth plans. Here's a chance for you to encourage them and also hold them accountable.

Check in on their employees’ professional growth and ensure that they properly challenged and fulfilled by their roles and responsibilities.
