# Effective 1-on-1s

## Benefits

### Build Trust
An opportunity to get to know each other on a personal level — which can, over time, lead to a stronger rapport and greater trust.

### Face-to-Face Time
Use these check-ins to understand how they can best support their direct reports, share an appreciation for their contributions, and get a pulse check on employee morale.

Gives you designated time to connect with your remote employees on a personal level, build trust, and ensure that they’re kept in the loop on projects and team updates.

### Provide Meaning to The Work
Day-to-day duties can feel disconnected from the company’s purpose and mission. 1-on-1s are a great place to help draw connections between the day-to-day work and its contributions to the department and organization.
### Cover Personal Topics
Provides a private and safe environment for employees to discuss more personal topics.

Once these issues are out in the open, managers can discuss the best way to move forward.

Be empathetic when people come forward with these types of challenges, so they feel supported and comfortable opening up about personal issues in the future

### Discuss Growth
This is also a good time to check in on how they are progressing with their growth plans. Here's a chance for you to encourage them and also hold them accountable.

Check in on their employees’ professional growth and ensure that they properly challenged and fulfilled by their roles and responsibilities.

### Helps Develop a Coaching Mindset
This is an opportunity for managers continue to develop their coaching skills to help support both performance and growth.
### Give/Receive Feedback
While you should strive to share feedback in as close to real-time as possible, there will also be opportunities to provide feedback based on items you discuss.

Because they are private and timely, regular 1-on-1s are also the perfect opportunity to share constructive feedback. While these might be difficult conversations to have, it’s better to address potential issues sooner rather than later so you can put a stop to worrisome behavior before it becomes an even larger problem.

As important as it is to give feedback, it's also important to provide a safe opportunity for direct reports to provide feedback.
## Preparing

### Establish Mindset
As a manager, your role is to coach and support while ensuring your employees remain the focus of the conversation. The conversation should be flexible enough to accommodate topics that are top of mind for both sides.

Have a shared collaborative space to keep track of upcoming topics to discuss.

### Establish Expectations
Set an agenda so both you and your direct report understand what will be covered.  Set the expectation that this meeting is for them, so ask them to come prepared as well.

Asking them to come prepared with topics is a simple, symbolic practice that helps them feel ownership and autonomy for their work and their time. You’re saying, “You tell me what’s important.”

### Set a Recurring Schedule
Work with your direct reports to decide how frequently they should meet (weekly, biweekly).  Some employees will want and need a more hands-on approach, while more autonomous individuals might prefer a less frequent or lengthy time commitment.  30 minutes should suffice but plan for your sessions to run over.  Try not to schedule something immediately afteward.
### Be Flexible
Change things up.  You don't have to cover the exact same topics every time.  For example, there may be times when your direct report really wants to talk about something that has been bothering him/her and is finally comfortable to share.  You may end up eating up the entire session only talking about that and that's ok.
## Conducting

### Listen Actively
Listen carefully to what is being shared and the feedback received. Remember, you’re not just listening to be polite, but rather to support your direct report in the best way possible.

Acknowledge and respect the other person's context and opinion. By doing so, you are more likely to build a stronger relationship with theim.

### Ask the Right Questions
Instead of asking surface-level questions, come prepared to follow up on the pleasantries by asking very specific questions that are relevant to the person and their work.

Making questions open-ended also allows your direct reports to lead the conversation and promotes more detailed discussions. 
### Get Personal
It’s helpful to share some personal anecdotes or experiences in the context of the 1-on-1. It eases any tensions and helps reinforce the human side of the relationship.

By sharing your personal experience, you provide not only guidance but also empathy and support to help the individual more sustainably. By getting personal, you also encourage direct reports to open up and share any problems they aren’t sure how to tackle.
### Cover The Right Topics
Avoid using 1-on-1s for status reports.  They should touch on morale, engagement, professional development, and career aspirations, while also leaving time for you to share feedback and provide coaching. That’s a lot to pack into a 30-minute meeting, so don’t feel like you have to address every topic every single time you meet. Just be sure to discuss each of these themes at least once a month so they remain top-of-mind and your direct reports know that you’re invested in their personal and professional growth.

### Take Notes
Make sure that nothing falls through the cracks during your conversation — like follow-ups or action items on either of your parts. This is especially important if your direct report asks for your help; you don’t want to forget to take an action you’d promised and risk damaging your relationship or credibility.

### Make it Actionable
End the meeting with clear, actionable steps. Use the last few minutes of the meeting to summarize the discussion, review notes, and discuss next steps.

Make sure both parties are aligned on what work needs to be done and by when, and answer any lingering questions.
