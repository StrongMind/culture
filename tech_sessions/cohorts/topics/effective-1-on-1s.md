# Effective 1-on-1s

## Benefits

### Build Trust
An opportunity to get to know each other on a personal level — which can, over time, lead to a stronger rapport and greater trust.

### Face-to-Face Time
Use these check-ins to understand how they can best support their direct reports, share an appreciation for their contributions, and get a pulse check on employee morale.

Gives you designated time to connect with your remote employees on a personal level, build trust, and ensure that they’re kept in the loop on projects and team updates.

### Provide Meaning to The Work
Day-to-day duties can feel disconnected from the company’s purpose and mission. 1-on-1s are a great place to help draw connections between the day-to-day work and its contributions to the department and organization.
### Cover Personal Topics
Provides a private and safe environment for employees to discuss more personal topics.

Once these issues are out in the open, managers can discuss the best way to move forward.

Be empathetic when people come forward with these types of challenges, so they feel supported and comfortable opening up about personal issues in the future

### Discuss Growth
This is also a good time to check in on how they are progressing with their growth plans. Here's a chance for you to encourage them and also hold them accountable.

Check in on their employees’ professional growth and ensure that they properly challenged and fulfilled by their roles and responsibilities.

### Helps Develop a Coaching Mindset
This is an opportunity for managers continue to develop their coaching skills to help support both performance and growth.
### Give/Receive Feedback
While you should strive to share feedback in as close to real-time as possible, there will also be opportunities to provide feedback based on items you discuss.

Because they are private and timely, regular 1-on-1s are also the perfect opportunity to share constructive feedback. While these might be difficult conversations to have, it’s better to address potential issues sooner rather than later so you can put a stop to worrisome behavior before it becomes an even larger problem.

As important as it is to give feedback, it's also important to provide a safe opportunity for direct reports to provide feedback.
## Preparing

### Establish Mindset
As a manager, your role is to coach and support while ensuring your employees remain the focus of the conversation. The conversation should be flexible enough to accommodate topics that are top of mind for both sides.

Have a shared collaborative space to keep track of upcoming topics to discuss.

### Establish Expectations
Set an agenda so both you and your direct report understand what will be covered.  Set the expectation that this meeting is for them, so ask them to come prepared as well.

Asking them to come prepared with topics is a simple, symbolic practice that helps them feel ownership and autonomy for their work and their time. You’re saying, “You tell me what’s important.”

### Set a Recurring Schedule
Work with your direct reports to decide how frequently they should meet (weekly, biweekly).  Some employees will want and need a more hands-on approach, while more autonomous individuals might prefer a less frequent or lengthy time commitment.  30 minutes should suffice but plan for your sessions to run over.  Try not to schedule something immediately afteward.
### Be Flexible
Change things up.  You don't have to cover the exact same topics every time.  For example, there may be times when your direct report really wants to talk about something that has been bothering him/her and is finally comfortable to share.  You may end up eating up the entire session only talking about that and that's ok.
