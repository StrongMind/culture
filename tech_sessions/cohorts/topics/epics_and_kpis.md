## Epic
- represents the value we are seeking
- is a container for the work to acheive the value

## An Epic has four primary components:

1. Definition (What and Why)
* Name of the Epic (What)
* Value Statement (Why)

2. Acceptance Criteria (Success Looks Like)

               It shall do this

               It shall do that

3. KPI’s

               Should have X% increase in Y showing [some type of] value.

4. Stories

               As a [user] I want to [have something] so that I may [achieve something]
               
 ## Define
 The Title should reflect the Value we want to achieve
 The Value Statement describes why this work is valuable
 - one way to get to the value is to use the 5 Whys Process

## Acceptance Criteria
clearly defines expectations of what should be accomplished to achieve the value of the epic
This shows what needs to be done to complete the epic, but does not show the value in the epic.

## KPIs
KPIs are the measures and milestones that indicate how you know you have acheived the value of the Epic
These can be measured at any time in the process.  The results determine if the epic can be considered done.  This is proving the value.

good KPIs have several basic characteristics:

-They are specific and time-bound.
-They are aggressive, yet realistic.
-They are measurable and verifiable.

KPIs are not independent little goals to meet. They’re stepping stones on the way to achieving the Value.
So if you could achieve your Value without completing your KPIs, your KPIs probably aren’t the right milestones.
The same is true if you feel like you could complete all your KPIs and still not achieve your Value. 

## Types of KPIs
#### **Inputs**
Inputs are things that you can control.

The number of stores that open, relaunching a company website, reducing the weight of a component that’s manufactured — these are all inputs.

Example 1: To get our candidate elected, knock on at least 10,000 doors.
Example 2: Test three marketing campaigns to renew subscribers to our service.

#### **Outputs**
Outputs are the effects of your inputs. Increasing sales revenue, reaching performance benchmarks, or attracting a certain number of attendees to a conference — these are outputs.

Example 1: To get our candidate elected, get 20,000 people to commit to voting for her.
Example 2: Achieve a subscriber renewal rate above 63%.

#### **Outcomes**
Outcomes are a more advanced way to think about outputs. Outputs tend to describe the desired end result itself. Outcomes often emphasize the “before” and “after” more clearly than either an input or an output.

To clarify, let’s look at two sample Objectives and potential KPIs viewed through the lens of either being an input, output or outcome.

Objective: Get our candidate elected.

Input: Volunteers must knock on at least 10,000 doors.
Output: Get 20,000 people to commit to voting for our candidate.
Outcome: Our candidate wins more districts than they did in the previous election.
Value: Customers value our service.

Input: Run three marketing campaigns aimed at renewals.
Output: Achieve a 67% renewal rate.
Outcome: Increase renewal rates by 10%.

KPIs are tied to strategic outcomes. Generally, KPIs can be organized into these broad categories:

Strategic KPIs: These KPIs give a big-picture overview of your company’s performance. An example might be your overall market share.

Operational KPIs: These KPIs focus more on specific processes or efficiencies and tend to measure performance over a shorter time frame. An example of an operational measure might be your average monthly sales by region.

Functional Unit or Project KPIs: This type of KPI is tied to a specific function, department (such as HR), or project (such as a new product launch). One example of a functional unit KPI could be the average time to resolve a customer query.

Risk KPIs: These KPIs focus on minimizing internal and external risk factors. For example, a KPI might be the cost of risk management programs or the number of risks identified.

Employee KPIs: This category of KPIs focuses on human behavior and employee performance. An example of an employee measure might be staff retention rates.

## How to Develop a KPI Strategy
To create and implement your KPI strategy, utilize the SMARTER System:

Specific: What exactly do you want to measure?
Measurable: Can this KPI be easily quantified?
Attainable: Is it realistic to meet this KPI in the time frame you’ve set?
Relevant: How does this KPI relate to your work?
Time-Bound: What is the timeline for meeting this KPI?
Explainable: Is the definition clear to all the stakeholders involved?
Relative: Does this KPI move in relation to your business goals?
