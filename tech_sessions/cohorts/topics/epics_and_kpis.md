## Epic
- represents the value we are seeking
- is a container for the work to acheive the value

## An Epic has four primary components:

1. Definition (What and Why)
* Name of the Epic (What)
* Value Statement (Why)

2. Acceptance Criteria (Success Looks Like)

               It shall do this

               It shall do that

3. KPI’s

               Should have X% increase in Y showing [some type of] value.

4. Stories

               As a [user] I want to [have something] so that I may [achieve something]
               
 ## Define
 The Title should reflect the Value we want to achieve
 The Value Statement describes why this work is valuable
 - one way to get to the value is to use the 5 Whys Process

## Acceptance Criteria
clearly defines expectations of what should be accomplished to achieve the value of the epic
This shows what needs to be done to complete the epic, but does not show the value in the epic.

## KPIs
KPIs are the measures and milestones that indicate how you know you have acheived the value of the Epic
These can be measured at any time in the process.  The results determine if the epic can be considered done.  This is proving the value.

good KPIs have several basic characteristics:

-They are specific and time-bound.
-They are aggressive, yet realistic.
-They are measurable and verifiable.

KPIs are not independent little goals to meet. They’re stepping stones on the way to achieving the Value.
So if you could achieve your Value without completing your KPIs, your KPIs probably aren’t the right milestones.
The same is true if you feel like you could complete all your KPIs and still not achieve your Value. 

## Types of KPIs
#### **Inputs**
Inputs are things that you can control.

The number of stores that open, relaunching a company website, reducing the weight of a component that’s manufactured — these are all inputs.

Example 1: To get our candidate elected, knock on at least 10,000 doors.
Example 2: Test three marketing campaigns to renew subscribers to our service.

#### **Outputs**
Outputs are the effects of your inputs. Increasing sales revenue, reaching performance benchmarks, or attracting a certain number of attendees to a conference — these are outputs.

Example 1: To get our candidate elected, get 20,000 people to commit to voting for her.
Example 2: Achieve a subscriber renewal rate above 63%.

#### **Outcomes**
Outcomes are a more advanced way to think about outputs. Outputs tend to describe the desired end result itself. Outcomes often emphasize the “before” and “after” more clearly than either an input or an output.

To clarify, let’s look at two sample Objectives and potential KPIs viewed through the lens of either being an input, output or outcome.

Objective: Get our candidate elected.

Input: Volunteers must knock on at least 10,000 doors.
Output: Get 20,000 people to commit to voting for our candidate.
Outcome: Our candidate wins more districts than they did in the previous election.
Value: Customers value our service.

Input: Run three marketing campaigns aimed at renewals.
Output: Achieve a 67% renewal rate.
Outcome: Increase renewal rates by 10%.

# potential other version of KPI 
(what is a kpi)[https://www.spiderstrategies.com/blog/what-is-a-kpi/]

KPIs are tied to strategic outcomes. Generally, KPIs can be organized into these broad categories:

**Strategic KPIs**: These KPIs give a big-picture overview of your company’s performance. An example might be your overall market share.

**Operational KPIs**: These KPIs focus more on specific processes or efficiencies and tend to measure performance over a shorter time frame. An example of an operational measure might be your average monthly sales by region.

**Functional Unit or Project KPIs**: This type of KPI is tied to a specific function, department (such as HR), or project (such as a new product launch). One example of a functional unit KPI could be the average time to resolve a customer query.

**Risk KPIs**: These KPIs focus on minimizing internal and external risk factors. For example, a KPI might be the cost of risk management programs or the number of risks identified.

**Employee KPIs**: This category of KPIs focuses on human behavior and employee performance. An example of an employee measure might be staff retention rates.

## How to Develop a KPI Strategy
To create and implement your KPI strategy, utilize the SMARTER System:

Specific: What exactly do you want to measure?
Measurable: Can this KPI be easily quantified?
Attainable: Is it realistic to meet this KPI in the time frame you’ve set?
Relevant: How does this KPI relate to your work?
Time-Bound: What is the timeline for meeting this KPI?
Explainable: Is the definition clear to all the stakeholders involved?
Relative: Does this KPI move in relation to your business goals?

## Storytelling
* it's important to communicate why customers need your products in their lives
* Even if you have the best product in your industry, you will still lose to an inferior competitor if their team knows how to paint a clearer and more compelling picture of how their product will benefit customers
* Why? The human brain has evolved to continuously scan its environment for opportunities and threats, to ask itself every time it receives a new message: “Is this worth my time and attention?” To do that, our brains need to quickly make sense of all incoming information. If a message (say, your product’s promise to a user) is too complicated, that person’s brain will almost certainly ignore the message, determining it’s not worth the effort to keep working to figure it out.
* So how can you give your product’s message the best chance to break through that primitive brain filter so it instantly perceives what you’re saying as an “interesting opportunity” rather than “not worth processing”?
* it’s a framework that every one of us is deeply familiar with—fairy tales we heard as kids, and the movie we saw or novel we read last week—a story is the best way to simplify and package your product’s message.
* resource: https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-storyteller/

### Importance
* to simplify - allow the person to easily zero in on what you're trying to communicate. Example: trying to explain Amazon.com to someone who’d never heard of it, "an algorithm-driven software application built on the TCP/IP platform" vs "an online store”
* engage our emotions - emotions propel. If you are trying to persuade a market to try your new product, you will be much more successful by painting a picture for how that product will improve their lives (an emotional appeal) than by presenting a list of features or a comparison of how much more affordable your product is than a competitor’s (analytical appeals).

When you can describe an aspirational future for your user persona—“Imagine saving 15 hours of work a week with this product – time you can reclaim for more important tasks, or even just to have more freedom!”—you’ll be far more likely to move that persona to buy.
* easier to remember - people won't remember all the details. it’s the emotional moments, where something intrigues your audience, or worries them, that they’ll remember. So why not package your pitch into story form—something with emotional resonance, something that intrigues them, makes them curious, and makes them want more

### Stories are stories!
* When you’re trying to communicate a product requirement to your development team, you don’t want to explain how you want them to build something—Instead, you’re trying to communicate why you want them to build something.
* This is why you don’t tell your developers how to code what you need when to start, or which developers to put on which task. You simply tell that “the mobile user should have a persistent search bar at the top of each screen in the app.” From that simple one-line story, your developers have all of the information they need to get the job done.

### Marketing Materials
The hero: Your user
The goal: What your user wants (something to help them succeed or avoid failure)
The villain: Whatever is preventing your user from experiencing their goal today
The guide: Your product
“Is your team wasting time and productive energy every day jumping in and out of different messaging and collaboration apps to get your work done? (The villain.) With the XYZ app (the guide), you can do all of your collaboration—chat, share files, assign tasks, and even have a video call—all in the same online workspace. (The goal.) No more email clutter, no more app hopping, and you (the hero) will make your team more productive than ever.
