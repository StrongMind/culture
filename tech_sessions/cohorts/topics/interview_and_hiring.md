## What is our Process?

* Resume screen
* Code Exercise / Evaluating Work Out Put
* Cultural / Phone Screen
* Pairing Session (Engineering)

## Resumes what do we look for?
We may also find candidates through job fairs, network connections or other avenues. Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind when reviewing a resume. No single item should be a deal breaker, but together can paint a picture of the candidate. 
- general flow and length
- experiences
- skills (tech and non tech)
- indications of continued learning
- education
- at this stage we primarily opt in to moving forward
  
## Evaluating Work Out Put
Code, Project or Portfolio submission provide tangible samples of the candidates work and abilities. 
- GitHub profile/projects
- Product design portfolio
- UI/UX portfolio
- Product design submission (UI/UX and User Research candidates)
- Pizza Exercise submission

## Code Exercise
* [Pizza Server](https://github.com/StrongMind/culture/blob/master/recruit/full-stack-developer.md)

## What are we looking for here?
* Requirements provided but intentially open. Why?
* [Tips for reviewing](https://github.com/StrongMind/culture/blob/master/recruit/code_exercise_evaluation_rubric.md)

## Cultural / Phone Screen
* Focus on How they work
- Collaboration
- Healthy Conflict
- Passion
- Learning
- Communication Skills
- Valued technical practices
- Follow up questions from the resume or code exercise

## In Class Exercise
(_Goal is to experience the difference between asking hypothetical questions and experience based questions_)
Pair up with a Buddy
Round 1: 
Ask your buddy the interview question, "How would you deal with conflict?"

Round 2: 
Ask your buddy the interview question, "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a co-worker. How did you handle that?"

**Questions for the group:**
For the round 1 question, on a scale of 1-10 what is your level of confidence that you know the candidate has this skill?
How about round 2?
What are the big differences here?

## How you ask is as important as What you Ask
* Hypothetical vs Experience questions
- Use framing such as "Tell me about a time when" or "How have you navigated x" to focus on real past experiences
- Avoid Yes No questions
- Avoid Trick Questions
* Opportunity for us to know them and them to know us
- Remember they are also interviewing us


## Onsite Pairing Session
* The goal of the onsite pairing session is to provide a direct way to assess what the candidate is like to work with in a setting that aligns with cultural norms we value. 
* Format
    * 2-4 hours in length
    * 2-3 Strongmind Employees either pair in rotation or mob with the candidate
    * Often use the submitted code exercise as a starting point for questions, refactors or extension

## Providing Feedback
Sharing feedback from multiple touch points helps us to assess whether this candidate is likely to be a great team member. 
* HR Recruiting is our interface to the candidate
* Slack channel for each candidate
* Pros and Cons feedback 
* Multiple perspectives (it generally takes only one "thumbs down" to end the process)
