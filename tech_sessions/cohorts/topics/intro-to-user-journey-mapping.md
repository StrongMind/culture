# Introduction to User Journey Mapping

## What is a user journey map?
* Also called a customer journey map 
* A visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal
* Series of user actions on a timeline. The timeline is fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions in order to create a narrative. This narrative is condensed and polished, and visualized.

## Why use a user journey map?
* The process of creating a map forces conversation and an aligned mental model for the whole team
* The shared artifact resulting from the mapping can be used to communicate an understanding of your user or service to all involved
* Uncovers hidden truths - often showcase situations that no one had planned for, and uncover interactions that weren't thought about previously
* Enables customer-centric focus, can enhance the UX which can help with product and feature adoption


## Key components of a user journey map
* Format
1. Actor
* Persona or user in the journey. Only one user per journey map!
2. Scenario & Expectations
* Actor's goal or need & expectations. Can be real or anticipated.
* Best if scenario involve a sequence of events
3. Journey Phases 
* different high-level stages in the journey
* Example: For an ecommerce scenario (like buying Bluetooth speakers), the phases can be discover, try, buy, use, seek support.
4. Actions, Mindsets, Emotions
* behaviors, thoughts, and feelings the actor has throughout the journey and that are mapped within each of the journey phases
* Actual behaviors and steps taken by users. Not meant to be a granular step-by-step log of every discrete interaction.
* Mindsets correspond to users’ thoughts, questions, motivations, and information needs at different stages in the journey. Ideally, these are customer verbatims from research.
* Emotions are plotted as single line across the journey phases, literally signaling the emotional “ups” and “downs” of the experience. Think of this line as a contextual layer of emotion that tells us where the user is delighted versus frustrated. 
5. Opportunities
* insights gained from mapping; they speak to how the user experience can be optimized. Insights and opportunities help the team draw knowledge from the map. What needs to be done with this knowledge? Who owns what change? Where are the biggest opportunities? How are we going to measure improvements we implement?
