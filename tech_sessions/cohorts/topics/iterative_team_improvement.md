# Iterative Team Improvement

## What it is
My team owns its own improvement. We improve via iterative experiments. We are always running an experiment, but each one is short. This maximizes the amount we can learn.

We do not expect all possible changes to work. So we try things, measure results, and make habits out of the changes that give good outcomes.

Although the most important part of the process is the experiments, we do need to agree, as a team, about what experiment to run. We achieve this agreement by a particular form of retrospective.

Each iteration of the process follows this sequence:

1. Gather data.
2. Pick something to address (systematic problem to fix or lucky win to make systematic). This is your objective.
3. Root cause analysis (if a problem) or contributing factor analysis (if a lucky win).
4. Solution ideation.
5. Pick one to try. This is your activity.
6. Define measures (1 measure of whether you implemented the activity + 1 measure of how it impacted your objective). This defines your experiment.
7. Run the experiment. Gather data as you go.
8. Assess results.
9. Decide whether to enact new thing as a change.

## How it helps
First, the focus on experimentation allows the team to try new stuff even when people think it might not work. We can try out several potentially good ideas and choose the one that works best for us in practice.

Second, the short experiment cycle forces us to make small experiments. This helps us verify one piece of understanding at a time. It reduces the risk: if our experiment breaks things, we will only experience those problems for 2 days.

Most importantly, the short cycle time allows us to focus on one thing at a time. If something ends up being the second-most important item, it will come up again in 2 days. We can deal with it then. We focus on locking in one gain on our most important problem. Every 2 days. Then we repeat.

## Mindshifts
Most mindshifts impact the team:
* We own our destiny. Our process, product, and people are our own.
* Stop making suggestions; start making decisions.
* Big bets cause high risk with moderate return. Bit improvements come from small steps.
* None of us has the right answer. We have ideas worth experiments.
* There is no such thing as a failed experiment unless it gives no result. Any outcome is of equal value to any other. Optimizing our process happens by choosing which experiments to adopt as changes.
* Work to improve your team’s effectiveness is valuable work. Do it and celebrate it.

A few also apply to change agents (Scrum masters, management, consultants, PMOs):
* The change agent does not have the answer. Good change agents help teams see what objectives are possible, then get out of the way.
* Nurture your team’s ability to apply its intelligence, rather than your ability to solve problems.
* Don’t unify activity from team to team. Raise bar on objectives; local variation is an evolutionary advantage.
* Expect to spend time and effort on improvement via this process (and others). Budget accordingly.

## Recipes to follow
Keep your process improvement cycle to 2 days unless your sprint cadence is faster. Even for a faster planning / delivery cadence, you might consider keeping the improvement cadence at 2 days.
Slower than 2 days makes it take longer to learn. It also makes it hard to pick one thing to do and to focus on small changes that are within your power to enact.

Faster than 2 days can make it feel like you spend all your time in process improvement meetings, rather than getting work done.

If you do this every 2 days, expect your retrospective to take 45 minutes. This is long enough to get all the way through experiment design—just barely. Make sure not to squander time in data analysis or choosing the right thing. You will get another attempt in 2 days.

If you do this at a longer cadence, expect the amount of meeting time to scale linearly with the frequency. Weekly retros that result in real process changes take a bit over 90 minutes. So you might as well keep it shorter and learn faster.

Make sure all the right people are in the room, just as you would for any other retro activity. Even more than with outcome-based retros, this process results in real change decisions and experiment definitions happening every time. You cannot afford for these to become recommendations.

Never run more than one experiment at a time. Consider running no experiments if you are trying to adopt a challenging habit. You want to focus the whole team on one thing, then build on it. Make sure not to accrue any process debt: things we say we do, but don’t really do, or do only with continual, conscious effort.

For each step of the process, pick one activity to facilitate that step. An example would be:
1. Gather data (+/-/?, 10 min)
2. Pick objective (dot vote, 2 min)
3. Root cause (fishbone diagram, 10 min)
4. Pick area (circle vote, 2 min)
5. Solution generation (1-2-4-all, 10 min)
6. Pick activity (dot vote, 2 min)
7. Define measures (open discussion + thumb vote, 8 min)
8. Run experiment (as per the experiment; measure data several times during the period)
9. Assess results (read before + two words + thumb vote, 2 min)

Many books contain alternative activity ideas for data gathering. Examples include timeline, pile of stickies, and mind map.

There are also good techniques for root cause analysis, such as 5 whys, mind map, and speedboat.

## Attaining Fluency
You are fluent when your team runs an experiment every time period and those experiments are always implemented (according to their measure of implementation). They may or may not have the desired impact, but the team always gets data.

## Recipes

As your fluency improves, you might consider slowing down your cadence to weekly. This can allow experiments that take longer to observe results. However, it can also just weaken discipline and allow the team to stop making as good of experiments.

Do not slow the cadence below weekly. Any cycle time longer than 1 week simply places too much at risk. If the experiment doesn’t work out, then the loss is too high. So you have to do conservative experiments.

Furthermore, you don’t get to run as many per year, so you start needing to run multiple in parallel. This results in a division of focus and a lower percentage of experiments actually getting run.

Avoid all of these problems by keep your cadence to no slower than weekly. Every other day remains a healthy cadence in perpetuity.

Some teams do after-action improvements after any significant problem. Even if your team starts doing this, keep up your regular iterative improvements. The two find different kinds of things.

Most teams start by focusing on their problems. This is a great way to start, but you need to go further to attain fluency. Pick a series of experiments where you will only work on lucky wins that you want to make systemic. Look at building a system that reinforces the things you want to have happen.

Teams that only practice fixing problems can develop codependency: they get really good at creating and fixing problems. Avoid this by focusing on things that went well and how you can make them more likely to recur.
