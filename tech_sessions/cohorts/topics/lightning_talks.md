# Lightning Talks

## What is a lightning talk?
* Short-form talks
* Each speaker gets five minutes
* The main goal is to spark conversations and collaborations across disciplines with fast-paced presentations

## Topics
* Don't assume that your audience will already know about your topic. Either they won't know or they will learn something new!
* Consider the following questions to come up with your topic
1. What technical demos could you present?
2. What are some of your technical strengths and/or skills?
3. What is something you are interested in?

## Present
* Create a short presentation of only a few slides to help illustrate your points
* Have fun! Remember, you're not there to teach a skill. You are there to spark interest, conversation, and collaboration!

## Presentations
* Let's hear those lightning talk presentations!
