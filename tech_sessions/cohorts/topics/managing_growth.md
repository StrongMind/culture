# Managing and Evaluating Growth

## The Importance of Growth

### Introduction
Employee growth is the continuous process of efforts for professional improvement among the members of a company. It is about setting goals that help determine their career paths.

It aims to see the continuous evolution of employees as professionals. It is a growth in their role as people who can have aspirations and go beyond their short, medium, and long-term goals. It is essential to take into account that achieving goals on a professional level implies improvement on a personal level.

Employee growth strategies must promote employees’ comprehensive development, all the way from their personal growth to the development of emotional and professional skills.  Utilizing growth plans helps add a level of accountabilty to help employees stay on track with their growth trajectory.

### Supporting Growth

Education, training, and professional improvement programs are integral to support the professional and personal growth needs of employees. It is essential to make them feel identified with their work environment and aligned with the company’s values.  The development of employee growth is frequently confused with the management of performance. Although they are closely related and overlap, it's important to understand that there are distincions which make growth different than performance.

In order to support growth, as managers we need to help our direct reports...
* Identify the areas where they want to grow which aligns to their career and overall life apsirations
* Create growth plans to identify deliberate practice areas for building or improving new or existing skills
* Evaluate where they currently stand and how they are improving over time, so they can get the proper feedback to understand where they might need to amplify our course correct.

## Identifying Areas for Growth

### Goal Setting

In order for people to feel motivated to want to improve themselves, they need to first determine why they want to grow.  Along their journey, this helps provide them with motivation to continue their deliberate practice even when it becomes hard or boring.  For that, we need a way to discover that North Star.  The first step is to have people determine *"What do I want to be when I grow up"*.

We then go through the process of helping them understand where they are relative to that broader goal, what they need to do to fulfill that goal, and what type of things might stand in their way.

### The StrongMinder's Journey

The [StrongMinder's Journey](https://strongmind.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PENG/pages/1033699373/StrongMinder+s+Journey) is a personal development tool. It's designed to be a mechanism to guide discussion and action when assessing employee's current behaviors and where they can improve personally and professionally. It should be used as a mechanism to assist assessing their current behaviors and where they can develop or enhance their skills.

Everyone is provided with a tool to be able to assess their own skill level for each of the SMJ competenencies and for managers to be able to perform their own assessment.  For managers, specifically, assessments are done quarterly so as to see the progression of growth over time.

Once individuals understand what they want to be when they grow up, they can begin to understand which areas they would like to grow and use the same techniques as above to understand...
* Where they currently stand skillwise for a particular competency
* What they need to do to improve their skill in that compentency
* What headwinds might hold them back
