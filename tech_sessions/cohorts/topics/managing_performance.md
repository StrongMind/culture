## Importance of Managing Performance

Modern approaches to performance management seek to align efforts with organizational goals and develop each employee’s potential in real time. 

## Setting Expectations

Expectations can be set using a varity of techniques.

### Cultrual

Culturual norms are set of behaviors that are inherent to an organization that may or may not be expressly written down.  These are things are learned over time based on observing others or getting guidance from others with more experience in the organization.

### Role Based

Using inputs such as a job description or the [StrongMinder's Journey](https://strongmind.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PENG/pages/1033699373/StrongMinder+s+Journey), managers can help individuals understand what's expected of them given their role and level.  While the StrongMinder's Journey is primarly used for growth, it can also tell us where individuals are deficient or excelling in terms of what is expected for their role and level.

## Evaluating

We've writen a draft document around the more [formal process of evaluating performance](https://strongmind.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EM/pages/2974974576/Employee+Evaluation+Process+draft).  But, we need to remember that evaluating performance is an ongoing processs and there are takeaways 

### Monitoring and Measuring

The [inputs section of the Employee Evaluation Process](https://strongmind.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EM/pages/2974974576/Employee+Evaluation+Process+draft#Inputs) lists the ways in which we can observe and measure performance.

The important takeway is that there is no single input we should latch onto.  In order to get a well rounded view, it requires different types of inputs including measuring quality and quantity of output, but also observation and feedback from others. 

## Accountability

Simply setting expectations is not enough. It's important as managers that we hold individuals accountable to those expectations.  Accountablility takes on many forms.  It's important that it doesn't mean berrating individuals for every little thing they've done wrong.  In order for accountability to be effective it must be well rounded.
### Coaching

The coaching stage of performance management sets the tone for your company and the success of your employees. Coaching involves training, outlining standards and goals, two-way feedback, and collaboration to help employees get better.

Ensure you provide *continuous* coaching and challenge your employees at this stage. Take their feedback into consideration, listen to any concerns they may have, and provide appropriate support. As a manager, you are responsible for helping your staff build their capability. You should stay attuned to the different learning styles of your staff - do they work better with written or verbal instructions? Do they prefer you to be hands on or hands off? Ensure you tailor your coaching style to the individual.

When invididuals get feedback in the form of coaching from managers in the flow of work, they can adjust their behavior and mindset. This exchange can build trust because employees see their managers want to help them improve. Moreover, employees aren’t surprised by feedback that only arrives weeks or months later.
