# Observation Exercise

Find 2 videos from HotJar and answer the following questions:

* **What tools did they use?** – how they are using those tools? Are they using them for their intended purpose? Do the tools being used interact?
* **What sequence did the actions occur?** – Was the order disrupted? Did the order actually matter?
* **What kinds of interactions did they have?** – who is the user and what is their role? What do people expect from these interactions vs. what outcomes are they getting?
* **What recommendations do you have for what you observed?**
