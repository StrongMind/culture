## Password Checker TDD Lab

Build a simple tool to check the strength of a supplied password. Adapted from https://github.com/clayton/password-checker-tdd-lab

### Iteration 1

* The length of the password must be at least 7 characters in length
* The password must contain at least 1 letter
* The password must contain at least 1 digit

### Iteration 2

We need to add support for checking admin passwords

* Admin passwords must be at least 10 characters in length
* Admin passwords must contain at least 1 special character

### Iteration 3

We need to provide feedback to the user about the strength of their password

* Provide the user with a list of reasons why their password is 'weak'
