# Power of Sketching

## What is sketching?
* Different than a wireframe
* A basic way to get the concept of how the interface will work
* Quick and dirty thinking that happens with pen and paper or whiteboard
* Specifics are not important
  
## Why sketch?

* Helps translate an idea to a user interface
* Helps you know what the user will see on each screen
* It's a good way to experiment with the different ways a user can accomplish a task
* Allows you to not focus on every detail of an interface
* Allows you to express your ideas quickly
* It's a good way to involve others in creating the user experience
* Helps put everyone on the same page so the team can move forward with mutual understanding
* It's faster to draw on paper than to push pixels
