## Section 7: Before the Project

1. Can you use the software you are writing? Is it possible to have a good feel for requirements without being able to use the software yourself? 
2. Pick a non-computer-related problem you currently need to solve. Generate requirements for a non-computer solution.
3. Which of the following are probably genuine requirements? Restate those that are not to make them more useful (if possible). 
   * The response time must be less than 500 ms. 
   * Dialog boxes will have a gray background. 
   * The application will be organized as a number of front-end processes and a back-end server. 
   * If a user enters non-numeric characters in a numeric field, the system will beep and not accept them. 
   * The application code and data must fit within 256kB.
4. Take a hard look at whatever difficult problem you are embroiled in today. Can you cut the Gordian knot? Ask yourself the key questions we outlined above, especially "Does it have to be done this way?" 
5. Were you handed a set of constraints when you signed on to your current project? Are they all still applicable, and is the interpretation of them still valid?
6. Discuss the fear-of-starting syndrome with your colleagues. Do others experience the same thing? Do they heed it? What tricks do they use to overcome it? Can a group help overcome an individual's reluctance, or is that just peer pressure?
7. The shoelace example mentioned in the text is an interesting illustration of the problems of written descriptions. Did you consider describing the process using diagrams rather than words? Photographs? Some formal notation from topology? Models with wire laces? How would you teach a toddler? Sometimes a picture is worth more than any number of words. Sometimes it is worthless. If you find yourself overspecifying, would pictures or special notations help? How detailed do they have to be? When is a drawing tool better than a whiteboard?
8. Use case diagrams are part of the UML process for gathering requirements (see The Requirements Pit, page 202). Are they an effective way of communicating with your users? If not, why are you using them? 
9. How can you tell if a formal method is bringing your team benefits? What can you measure? What constitutes an improvement? Can you distinguish between benefits of the tool and increased experience on the part of team members? 
10. Where is the break-even point for introducing new methods to your team? How do you evaluate the trade-off between future benefits and current losses of productivity as the tool is introduced? 
11. Are tools that work for large projects good for small ones? How about the other way around?
