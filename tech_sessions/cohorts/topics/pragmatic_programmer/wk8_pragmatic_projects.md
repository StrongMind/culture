## Section 8: Pragmatic Projects

1. Look around for successful teams outside the area of software development. What makes them successful? Do they use any of the processes discussed in this section? 
2. Next time you start a project, try convincing people to brand it. Give your organization time to become used to the idea, and then do a quick audit to see what difference it made, both within the team and externally. 
3. Team Algebra: In school, we are given problems such as "If it takes 4 workers 6 hours to dig a ditch, how long would it take 8 workers?" In real life, however, what factors affect the answer to: "If it takes 4 programmers 6 months to develop an application, how long would it take 8 programmers?" In how many scenarios is the time actually reduced?
4. Look at your habits throughout the workday. Do you see any repetitive tasks? Do you type the same sequence of commands over and over again? Try writing a few shell scripts to automate the process. Do you always click on the same sequence of icons repeatedly? Can you create a macro to do all that for you? 
5. How much of your project paperwork can be automated? Given the high expense of programming staff,[5] determine how much of the project's budget is being wasted on administrative procedures. Can you justify the amount of time it would take to craft an automated solution based on the overall cost savings it would achieve? [5] For estimating purposes, you can figure an industry average of about US$100,000 per head—that's salary plus benefits, training, office space and overhead, and so on.
6. Can you automatically test your project? Many teams are forced to answer "no." Why? Is it too hard to define the acceptable results? Won't this make it hard to prove to the sponsors that the project is "done"? Is it too hard to test the application logic independent of the GUI? What does this say about the GUI? About coupling?
7. Did you write an explanatory comment for the source code you just wrote? Why not? Pressed for time? Not sure if the code will really work—are you just trying out an idea as a prototype? You'll throw the code away afterwards, right? It won't make it into the project uncommented and experimental, will it? 
8. Sometimes it is uncomfortable to document the design of source code because the design isn't clear in your mind; it's still evolving. You don't feel that you should waste effort describing what something does until it actually does it. Does this sound like programming by coincidence (page 172)?
9. Sometimes the toughest critics of a project are the people who worked on it. Have you ever experienced disappointment that your own expectations weren't met by something you produced? How could that be? Maybe there's more than logic at work here. 
10. What do your users comment on when you deliver software? Is their attention to the various areas of the application proportional to the effort you invested in each? What delights them?
