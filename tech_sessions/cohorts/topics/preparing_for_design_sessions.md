# A Guide for Product Managers: Preparing for a Successful Design Studio

## What is a design studio?
- An hour set aside every where you can utilize Search Party, stakeholders, and engineers to help solve a new or existing design challenge. These sessions are meant to help you with solution discovery.
- Design sessions are used when we understand the problem to be solved and are ready for some ideas on how to solve that problem through the UI. 
- They should be used to solve a specific problem and should not be used to solve a broad problem.

## How to Prepare for a Design Studio
1. Identify the problem to solve
- Make sure you have a clearly defined problem to solve. You'll be asked to explain the problem at the beginning of the design studio.
- It should ideally be from one user's perspective.
- Make sure the scope isn't too big! We only have 1 hour.

2. Set up the meeting
- Post in #group-devmgrs-product tagging @jen to request one and be sure to include the topic.
- Make sure you know what stakeholders need to be involved keeping in mind that these are optimized for in-person.
- Work with Jen to find the next available date.
- Jen or a member from New52 will add the appropriate people to the invite.

### Meeting Participants
- By inviting participants with different skill sets, you invite ideas from different perspectives.
- As a *Product Manager*, you'll want to provide a clear problem overview, align stakeholders, and guide discussions towards user needs and business goals.
- *UX Researchers* will bring insights from user research, validate assumptions, and advocate for user-centered design decisions.
- *UX Engineers* will likely be focusing on on visual design, usability, and interaction patterns, ensuring consistency and adherence to design guidelines.
- *Engineers* will be concerned about the technical feasibility during the idea brainstorming. They can't help themselves from thinking about the implementation details and may want to suggest efficient solutions.

3. Setting up the room
- Creating the right environment is key to fostering creativity and collaboration.

*Action Steps*
- Set up a meeting room with necessary tools: whiteboard, markers, flip charts, paper, pens, tape, dot votes, sticky notes.
- Advocate for an open sharing of ideas and active discussions.
- Allocate time for individual ideation and group brainstorming.
- Promote the use of visual tools: sketches, diagrams, and annotations.
- Ensure a non-judgmental atmosphere where every idea is valued.
- Allow participants to share and explain their sketches and thoughts to the group.
- Playing music while sketching promotes creativity.

4. Presenting an overview of the problem to be solved
Understanding the problem is the first step to solving it.

*Action Steps*
- Write the user role on the whiteboard for all participants to see.
- Introduce the session's purpose and desired outcomes. Write this on the whiteboard as well.
- Clearly define pain points, challenges, and goals.
- Articulate the problem statement, emphasizing its importance. It is helpful to write these on the whiteboard as “How Might We” statements.
- Example: For an E-commerce platform, address the high cart abandonment rates and complexities in the checkout flow.

5. Leverage existing UI and UX patterns
Benefit from established design patterns and best practices.

*Action Steps*
- Research and familiarize yourself with successful design patterns related to the problem. This can be done in a few minutes before sketching begins.
- Explore products/platforms that have effectively addressed similar challenges.
- Example: For an E-commerce checkout process, consider the inclusion of progress indicators, simplified form fields, guest checkout options, and clear error messaging.

6. Create sketches
Start ideating.

*Action Steps*

- Allow participants to draw their own solutions individually. If there are a lot of people in the room, have them pair up for this part. They will still draw individually for the first step.
- Have each participant tape their sketch to a wall and present it to the group.
- After presentations, allow another time block to create new sketches incorporating any good ideas they liked from the other participants' sketches. If working in pairs, the pair will create one sketch for the pair.
- Each participant hangs their new sketch on the wall and presents it to the group.
- Allow each participant to “dot vote” on the features they liked best.

7. Follow up
After the session, summarize the discussions, and lay out the next steps.

*Action Steps*
- Take a picture of all artifacts and post them to the slack channel for the epic.
- Start developing User Stories that capture the work outlined in the session.
- Schedule follow-up discussions if needed.
- Initiate any action items discussed during the session.

## Other Uses of Design Studios
1. When Seeking Rapid Idea Generation
- If you're in the early stages of a product or feature and want to quickly sketch out potential user interactions or interfaces, a design session is invaluable.

2. To Address Specific User Pain Points
- If user feedback or research indicates a particular pain point, challenge, or area of frustration within the product, convene a session to address and solve it through design.

3. When Shaping "Jobs to be Done"
- When the team needs to understand or refine how users would accomplish specific tasks or achieve certain goals with the product, a design session can provide clarity.

4. Before Major UI/UX Changes
- Any substantial alterations to the product's design can greatly impact user experience. Holding a design session can ensure that these changes are well-thought-out and user-centric.

5. When Aligning Cross-Functional Teams
- If there's a need to ensure that product, design, engineering, and other teams share a unified vision for the product's design direction, a session can help bring everyone on the same page.

7. When Exploring New Technologies or Platforms
- If the product is venturing into new technological territories (e.g., AR/VR, voice interfaces), a design session can help brainstorm how the user experience might differ or need adaptation.

## TL;DR
I think I need a design studio, now what?

1. Identify the user and the pain point you're trying to address
2. Identify all the needed invitees
3. Request the design studio 
4. Post the notes and artifacts in the appropriate slack channel
