# A Guide for Product Managers: Preparing for a Successful Design Session

## Introduction
Design sessions are essential collaborative meetings where product managers work with UX researchers,
UI engineers, and full-stack engineers to create user-centric solutions. This course provides a concise
guide to help product managers effectively prepare for design sessions, covering the following key points:

## Meeting Participants
By inviting participants with different skill sets, you invite ideas from different perspectives.

* **UI Engineers:** will likely be focusing on on visual design, usability, and interaction patterns, ensuring consistency and adherence to design guidelines.
* **Full-Stack Engineers:** will be concerned about the technical feasibility during the idea brainstorming. They can't help themselves from thinking about the
   implementation details and may want to suggest efficient solutions.

## Setting the Stage for Idea Generation

* Introduce the purpose of the session and encourage a collaborative and creative environment.
* Clearly explain the design session's objectives and desired outcomes.
* Emphasize the importance of sharing ideas openly and actively engaging in discussions.
