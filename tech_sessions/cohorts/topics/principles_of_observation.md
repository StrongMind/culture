# Principles Of Observation

User research is about more than just discovering product requirements, but about understanding how people live their lives and how they might like to live differently. It’s about cultivating informed empathy for your users.

Usability testing is a form of a field method developed by anthropologists called “participant observation” – researchers actively take part in a group or individual’s activity to learn from them experientially.

### Why can’t we just ask people what they want/think?

* Psychology research tells us that people often idealize their needs and wants. What they say does not often line up with their actual needs, values, & behaviors. People are actually very poor predictors of their own behavior.

### There are a few great outcomes from observational research:

* we can specify concrete details about actual use
* we can surface hidden understandings
* we can challenge assumptions about our users.

### What we look for:

* **The tools they use** – and how they are using those tools. Are they using them for their intended purpose? Do the tools being used interact?
* **The sequences in which actions occur** – the order of action can indicate a person’s thought process. What happens when the order is disrupted? Does the order actually matter?
* **Their methods of organization** – people group information together, sometimes out of convenience and sometimes out of necessity. How do people organize the information?
* **What kinds of interactions they have** – who are the important parties and roles? What do people expect from these interactions vs. what outcomes are they getting?

## Main Principles of Field Observation

1. **Create as natural of an environment as possible** – context is very important to understanding human behavior, humans are conditioned  by their environments so they must be studied within these contexts. These contexts can be large (e.g., American society as a whole) or smaller (individual’s workplace or home environment). It is best to conduct studies in an environment that is as close as possible to the environment in which they would be occupying in the real world.
2. **Reduce observer bias** – it is impossible for you to observe anything totally objectively. You will always be viewing the world through your own cultural and personal lens. Awareness of that is crucial to observational research and there are many techniques we can employ to reduce that as much as possible. Always be aware of the bias you may be bringing into a study – for example, if you are an experienced “tech” person and you are studying a less technologically inclined person perform a task, you may make assumptions about the person’s intelligence/competency because they can’t figure something out. Don’t do that, because that will tempt you to discount their experience. Always assume your participants knows something you don’t.
3. **Minimize observer interference** – people behave differently when they know they are being watched, there is no real way around this. But like reducing bias, there are techniques we can employ to reduce observer interference or disruptions. Be as quiet as possible and only interject where absolutely necessary. If you have questions, jot them down and then ask at an appropriate time. If you are observing participants performing a task, do NOT try to help them figure it out. Let them sort it out on their own. You wouldn’t be there under normal circumstances, so it’s important to recreate that as well as possible. Be mindful of word choice, it is very easy to accidentally “lead” a participant by asking questions in certain ways.
