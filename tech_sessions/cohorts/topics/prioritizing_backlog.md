## What is the Backlog for Anyways?
communicating priority of work
communicating estimated delivery of Epics and Initiatives
Estimating cost of the work
Blending work efforts from different stakeholders
Organizing team sprints (keeping the team focused)
Prioritizing the backlog can provide a sense of direction and purpose for the team, leading to improved morale.

## What types of things might go into the backlog
A product backlog item can be new feature requests, epics or user stories, bugs, design changes, change requirements, technical debt, or action items from the retrospective.

## Who Adds Items to the Backlog?
* the Product Manager adds items to the team backlog
* Planned work brought into the backlog should have gone through Product Board Prioritization first
* Don't let teams add random items to the backlog, you are responsible for using the team's time to get the best outcome for the company (and customer). Ask questions to understand. 
* Bugs may be automatically added to your backlog from zendesk, sentry and other systems

## Factors that go into Prioritization

Business value
Complexity
Minimizing risks
Opportunity to gain a competitive advantage
Time to develop
Cost to develop and implement
Dependencies
Number of users/frequency of users affected by the change

### So....Who's on First?
Prioritization is an art and a science...and a balancing act
All feature work? You might be ignoring bugs and maintenance that will come back to haunt you. 
All bugs and maintenance? Your Stakeholders will be wondering where their features are...they need Value. 

There are some frameworks that Product folk use to help determine what to work on

### Impact vs Effort

The goal of an Epic is to deliver value and meet success criteria which result in meeting KPIs
....not necessarily to deliver each story the Epic started with
....if you get the Value of an Epic without all the Stories you are saving costs
* Focus on getting Quick Wins where you can. Deliver value early
* Big bets can be big value but carry more risk. Don't overload on these
* Incremental improvements are good fill ins.
* Avoid Money Pits, if you think a requirement is a money pit ask some more questions and seek other solutions before committing the team to that work

### RICE Framework
Items are scored according to the four factors that give the method its name (Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort). This RICE score allows quantifying importance and comparing initiatives or feature ideas.
**Reach** estimate how many people the feature or product will affect within a given time period
**Impact** estimate the impact on an individual e.g. increase adoption, reduce effort etc (use a number scale like 3 for “massive impact”, 2 for “high”, 1 for “medium”, 0.5 for “low”, and finally 0.25 for “minimal”. These numbers get multiplied into the final score to scale it up or down.
**Confidence** a percetage measure of Your confidence of the other estimates, this might go up or down depending on the data you have to back up your estimates
**Effort** estimate the total amount of time required from your team (you can use sprints for Epic sized efforts or use story points if the work has been broken down)

Reach x Impact X Confidence / Effort = RICE Score

Use RICE scores to rank work into Priority by score

### Stakeholder Input
In our environment, there are multiple stakeholders who have differing needs, wants and end users
* Gather diverse stakeholders to prioritize into as few "streams of work" as possible
    * Planned Strategic
    * Planned Non-Strategic
* Using the Impact Matrix or RICE Framework with Stakeholders can help them in making the tough decisions on their true priorities


## I Have Epics Ready for My Backlog...Now What?

**Start with the Roadmap**
* 2 Epics in Progress max
* Blend in Strategic and Non-Strategic work
* Are any known dependencies on other work or teams?

**Determine Sprint Capacity**
* Use Jira Backlog Insights as a guide
* Bring sized items into sprint
* If you have unsized items, ask for sizing after standup
     * sizing should take a couple minutes at most

**Help the team stay focused**
* Group work in related systems together when possible
* Having work ready in multiple sprints allows them to pull in more if they have capacity

**Bugs!**
* Bugs should be processed regularly
* Urgent issues (like outages) should be pulled into the current sprint
* Important but not urgent bugs can go into the next sprint
* Avoid a bug pile up in your backlog
