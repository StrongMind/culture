# Pros and Cons Decision Making

## Define the Problem

It is crucial that all members of the decision making group understand the problem to solve. 
* Define the problem
  * Who is impacted
  * What they would like to do
  * What is currently happening
* Use visual aids like flow or system diagrams
* Encourage others to ask questions 

## Generate Options
Leverage diverse appoaches to the problem by gathering ideas from the group. 
* Using sticky notes to capture ideas encourages less vocal participants
* Drawing together


## Select an Approach
There are several tools and models that can be used in the decision making process. Which you choose largely depends on the composition and collaboration style of the decision making group. 

**The Pro / Con List**
Write Pros on one side and Cons on the other
Score each Pro with 0 to +5
Score each Con with 0 to -5
Sum each side to determine if it makes sense to proceed with the solution

**Impact / Effort Matrix**
Draw two axis - 
* Impact going up from low to high
* Effort going to the right from low to high

For each potential approach, place it on the chart according to level of effort and probably impact

**Analysis Matrix**
List the options in rows
In the columns across list the primary factors to consider
In the top row assign "weights" to each factor (1-5)

score each option by multiplying the factor score by the factor weight, then sum scores for each option

### What can go wrong?

**Procrastination or "Paralysis by Analysis"**
* Bias to action
* make cheap mistakes
* create quick feedback cycles
* make a proposal

**Not Considering the Ripple Effects**
* Consider the systems upstream and downstream which would be effected
* Involve consultants or reviewers from other teams


**Sunk Cost Fallacy**
The tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.
* We don't want "rewrites" but also don't double down on a bad idea
* Look for iterative paths to a better solution
