# Pros and Cons Decision Making

## Define the Problem

It is crucial that all members of the decision making group understand the problem to solve. 
* Define the problem
  * Who is impacted
  * What they would like to do
  * What is currently happening
* Use visual aids like flow or system diagrams
* Encourage others to ask questions 

## Generate Options
Leverage diverse appoaches to the problem by gathering ideas from the group. 
* Using sticky notes to capture ideas encourages less vocal participants
* Drawing together


## Select an Approach
There are several tools and models that can be used in the decision making process. Which you choose largely depends on the composition and collaboration style of the decision making group. 

**The Pro / Con List**
You are probably familiar with a basic pros and cons list, adding a score helps you visualize the relative impact of each item on the list. 

Write Pros on one side and Cons on the other
1. Score each Pro with 0 to +5
2. Score each Con with 0 to -5
3. Sum each side to determine if it makes sense to proceed with the solution

**Impact / Effort Matrix**
1. Draw two axis - 
2. Impact going up from low to high
3. Effort going to the right from low to high

For each potential approach, place it on the chart according to level of effort and probably impact

**Force Field Analysis**
This tool is especially useful to understand the forces for and against a proposed change. Each force is given a size or weight that represents how "strong" it is compared to other forces. 

1. In the center of your chart, describe the proposed change
2. On the left, list the forces that are in favor of change
3. On the right, list the forces that oppose (or are against) change
4. Use dot voting, sizing or another method to determine the strength rating for each force
5. Sum each side of the forces

**Analysis Matrix**
1. List the options in rows
2. In the columns across list the primary factors to consider
3. In the top row assign "weights" to each factor (1-5)

score each option by multiplying the factor score by the factor weight, then sum scores for each option

### What can go wrong?

**Procrastination or "Paralysis by Analysis"**
* Bias to action
* make cheap mistakes
* create quick feedback cycles
* make a proposal

**Not Considering the Ripple Effects**
* Consider the systems upstream and downstream which would be effected
* Involve consultants or reviewers from other teams


**Sunk Cost Fallacy**
The tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.
* We don't want "rewrites" but also don't double down on a bad idea
* Look for iterative paths to a better solution
