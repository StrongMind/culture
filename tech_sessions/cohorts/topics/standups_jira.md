## Stand-up Standards Daily
* Start with burn down chart.
    * Determine the delta and what it takes to be on track

* Collapse all items.
    * Review only those that are "In Progress / Blocked"
    * Filter by NOT DONE
    * Talk only about what will be done (not yesterday)
    * Do not allow someone to be assigned to more than one sub-task
    * Do not end meeting without everyone being on a sub-task
    * Do the math on what is left for a story if in 2 hour increments will completing them get back on task?
    * Fight against WIP limits that are too large (Don't start new things without finishing the old ones)
    * Ask questions about anything sitting in In Progress more than one day (the dots on the cards)
