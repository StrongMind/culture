# Storybook Basics

## What is a Design System?
* Collection of repeatable components
* Guidelines on the usage of the components (this differentiates it from a style guide or pattern library)
* Can be assembled together to build application
* Always evolving
* Examples: [Atlassian](https://atlassian.design/) and [Shopify](https://polaris.shopify.com/) 

## Importance
* Helps with product consistency
* Reduces development time

## What is Storybook?
* Open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.
* Uses [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## How to Use
* Find the component you're looking for under "Documentation" or "Atom"
* Copy the html by clicking "Show code"
* Under "Documentation" for the component you're looking for, there is a link to "View CSS on Github" or you can [find the CSS in Github here](https://github.com/StrongMind/strongmind-ui/tree/master/src)
* Reach out to Search Party for any components you're looking for that aren't there yet and we'll prioritze them
