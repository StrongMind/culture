# System Design

The process of designing the architecture, interfaces, and flow of data for a system to satisfy particular requirements

## Design Considerations

- What problem are we trying to solve?
- Functional requirements
  - high level stories
- Non-functional requirements
  - availability
  - consistency
  - latency
  - usage
  - performance

### Oh yeah, and that too...
- value delivery medium
  - mobile, web, etc
- security
- accessibility (a11y)
- internationalization (i18n)
- localization (l10n)

## Solutioning

### Approaches

- top down
- bottom up
- middle out

### Infrastructure

- monolith vs microservice
- horizontal vs vertical scaling
- storage
  - relational
  - NoSQL
  - graph

### Static Elements
- decomposition
- modules, components
- separation of concerns
- presentation
- persistence

### Dynamic Elements
- data flows
- interactions
- messaging
