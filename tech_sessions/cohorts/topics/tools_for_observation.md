### Events

Trigger sessions to record based on behavior

As users interact with your site, several things can happen. Users could be clicking buttons, scrolling, or typing. Your site might also be making elements load, errors appear, or page variants to be shown, such as in an A/B test. These occurrences are examples of actions that can be used with Hotjarâ€™s Events feature to help capture specific sessions and filter collected data to improve your insights.

### User Attributes

User Attributes are facts about your users that are sent to Hotjar. You can use them to filter Recording and Heatmap data, create Segments, or show Feedback widgets and Surveys only to specific users. User Attributes allow you to learn much more about the users you care about the most.
