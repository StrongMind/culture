# User Stories
## What is a User Story

A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

As a <*type of user*>, I want <*some goal*> so that <*some reason*>.

As a *consumer*, I want to *book a reservation for a flight* so that *I can travel to my vacation destination*

## Who Writes a User Story?

Anyone *can* write user stories.

It's the product owner's responsibility to manage and prioritize a backlog of user stories exists, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the product owner is the only one who is allowed to write them.

## Why User Stories?

User stories serve as the foundation on which teams build their work.
They simplify the essential and fundamentals requirements needed to deliver value.
They allow work to be prioritized and planned.

User stories are designed to strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them.

## What Makes a Good User Story?
### INVEST

**I**ndependent

You have to ensure that any changes to a User Story do not affect another. This is to avoid increasing the work burden and an effort to keep user stories simple.

**N**egotiable

One of the main purposes of creating user stories is to give your team flexibility in their working process. Hence, the team must be given free rein in the implementation of user stories.

**V**aluable

A user story should clearly state the value of the product to the user.

**E**stimatable

The development of the goals highlighted by the user story should be measurable. This will allow your team to determine their priorities as well as their working schedule.

**S**ized Appropriately

User stories need to be short. Stories that require multiple sprints to be completed or need a workforce of more than 10 people per day defeat the purpose of what a User Story needs to achieve.

**T**estable

User story need to have an achievable goal that can be tested to see if it delivers on user expectations.

## How Do We Gather User Stories
### User Interviews
Ask a diverse group of users o pen-ended questions containing "how" or "why."

i.e. *"How would you pair this device with your iPhone?"*

### Questionnaires

A list of questions or items used to gather data from respondents about their attitudes, experiences, or opinions.

### Observation

Watch people use the product/service.
### Story Workshops

A brainstorming session where the group identifies as many user story ideas as possible. To support getting a diverse set of ideas, the goal is to prioritize quanity over quality.
