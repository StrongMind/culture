# Wireframing Activity

## Warmup Activity
* Grab some blank paper and a sharpie
* Think about an app you use often (Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, your bank's app, Venmo, etc)
* Taking a few minutes, sketch out the app from memory!
  
## Wireframing Activity Step 1

* Grab a stack of blank paper and a sharpie or markers
* Generate an idea to sketch. You can use a story from your backlog or one of these idea generators: [Sharpen](https://sharpen.design/) or [Designercize](https://designercize.com/)
* Sketch out the user's experience on paper. Use one paper or "frame" per action. For example on page 1 there is a button, and on page 2 it shows what happens after they click on the button.
* Take 5-7 minutes for this step

## Wireframing Activity Step 2
* Partner up with someone 
* Each take a minute or 2 to share your sketches with eachother
* Discuss the best features of both sketches
* Create a new sketch that combines the best ideas from both sketches
