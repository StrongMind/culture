# Mobbing

Mobbing is a technique used in small teams to involve the whole team with problem solving.

The style of Mobbing that I have witnessed to have the most success works like this :

## Roles

### Driver

The drivers job is to act as hands for the navigator. They focus on the short term tactical goal the team has, in the same way as a driver from the driver/navigator pairing style.

In addition to the considerations normally applied to the driver navigator pairing style, the driver does not initiate conversation with the mob and the mob does not initiate conversation with the driver. This helps to avoid unstructured and undirected conversation in the mob, and allows the driver to stay focussed on the driver role.
