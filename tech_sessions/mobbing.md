# Mobbing

Mobbing is a technique used in small teams to involve the whole team with problem solving.

The style of Mobbing that I have witnessed to have the most success works like this :

## Roles

### Driver

The drivers job is to act as hands for the navigator. They focus on the short term tactical goal the team has, in the same way as a driver from the driver/navigator pairing style.

The driver does not write any code that they are not instructed to write by the navigator. This is particularly important if the driver is a more experienced programmer than the navigator, as this can lead to "watch the master" style mobbing or pairing which can lead to fast disengagement.

In addition to the considerations normally applied to the driver navigator pairing style, the driver does not initiate conversation with the mob and the mob does not initiate conversation with the driver. This helps to avoid unstructured and undirected conversation in the mob, and allows the driver to stay focussed on the driver role.

### Navigator

The navigators job is to direct the mob towards the larger goal the mob has, following the plan the mob has agreed upon beforehand.  The navigator holds the goal in their mind, and directs the driver toward the goal, drawing upon the resources of the remaining members of the mob.

The navigator asks questions of the mob to draw upon the mobs expertise and to create consensus when they feel that the plan does not cover the work that needs to be done in order to meet the larger goal.

### Mob

The role of the remaining members of the mob is to be a resource for the navigator to draw upon in order to achieve the mobs stated goal.  It is important to understand that unstructured conversation between the mob and others can detract forward movement.

If a member of the mob is concerned about a direction that the mob is taking, I have seen it be much more productive to raise a hand, rather than just interrupt the navigator and driver, and for the concern to be represented as a question. "If we do this this way, how will we avoid y problem?".
